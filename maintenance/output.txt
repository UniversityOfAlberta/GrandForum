            [description] => Users today can easily and intuitively record their real-world experiences through mobile devices, and commodity virtual worlds enable users from around the world to socialize in the context of realistic environments where they simulate real-world activities. This synergy of technological advances makes the design and implementation of trans-reality games, blending the boundaries of the real and virtual worlds, a compelling software-engineering problem. In this paper, we describe fAARS, a platform for developing and deploying trans-reality games that cut across the real and parallel virtual worlds, offering users a range of game-play modalities. We place fAARS in the context of recent related work, and we demonstrate its capabilities by discussing two different games developed on it, one with three different variants. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

            [description] => Acceptance testing is an important part of software development and it is performed to ensure that a system delivers its required functionalities. Today, most modern interactive web applications are designed using Web 2.0 technologies, many among them relying on JavaScript. JavaScript enables the development of client-side functionality through the dynamic modification of the web-page's content and structure without calls to the server. This implies that server-side testing frameworks will necessarily fail to test the complete application behaviors. In this paper we present a method for automated acceptance testing of JavaScript web applications to ensure that required functionalities have been implemented. Using an intuitive, human-readable scripting language our method allows users to describe user stories in high level declarative test scripts and to then execute these test scripts on a web application using an automated website crawler. We also describe a case study that evaluates our approach in terms of capabilities to translate user stories in automated acceptance test scripts. © 2012 IEEE.

            [description] => In this paper we propose a method for reverse engineering the features of Ajax-enabled web applications. The method first collects instances of the DOM trees underlying the application web pages, using a state-of-the-art crawling framework. Then, it clusters these instances into groups, corresponding to distinct features of the application. The contribution of this paper lies in the novel DOM-tree similarity metric of the clustering step, which makes a distinction between simple and composite structural changes. We have evaluated our method on three real web applications. In all three cases, the proposed distance metric leads to a number of clusters that is closer to the actual number of features and classifies web page instances into these feature-specific clusters more accurately than other traditional distance metrics. We therefore conclude that it is a reliable distance metric for reverse engineering the features of Ajax-enabled web applications. © 2013 IEEE.

            [description] => With the increasing adoption of the web-services stack of standards, service-oriented architecture has attracted substantial interest from the research community which has produced several languages and methods for describing and reasoning about services. These languages cover many concepts ranging from individual services and their code generation from specifications, service semantics, service compositions and networks, economics and business aspects around service ecosystems etc. However, this abundance of specification languages has also resulted in communication difficulties between stakeholders and hinders tasks such as service composition, discovery and maintenance. The presented work is a step towards the unification of the specifications and different aspects of service systems using Model-Driven Engineering. We propose a generic and abstract web service meta-model called WSMeta, which has the ability to describe both operation-centric web services (WS-*) and data-centric web services (REST) and can be used in tasks such as service evolution analysis and service systems maintenance.

            [description] => The distributed nature of service-oriented architectures imposes some very interesting challenges to the participants of a service system, i.e., the provider and the client. For example, the service may change in a way that no longer satisfies the client's needs, either due to its reduced offered functionality or quality, due to its reduced availability or due to its increased price. In this case, the client may seek to replace the consumed service with another from a competitive provider. The client will also have the challenging task of mapping the elements of the old service to those of the new service, in order to apply the appropriate changes to the client application. In this work, we propose a novel approach to perform this mapping based on the data exchanged by the service and the application (i.e., the values of the input and the output parameters of the service). This technique allows us to avoid any potential ambiguities in the vocabulary or the structure of service interfaces between different vendors. Eventually, we evaluate the performance of our mapping technique on different services from two domains, namely movie and geolocation services. © 2013 IEEE.

            [description] => Computational-thinking skills are an essential intellectual amplifier for all scientific and professional disciplines. Embedding these skills in the K-12 and University curricula is necessary for training the next generation of thinkers. A widely adopted approach to doing so is through simple and visual programming languages like Scratch and engaging assignments like video-game construction. In this work, we report on an empirical study we conducted with senior undergraduate education students aiming to understand how prior experience enables students to better develop their computation-thinking skills through a Scratch-based video-game assignment. © 2014 IEEE.

            [description] => Cloud-based infrastructures enable applications to collect and analyze massive amounts of data. Sometimes these applications are the product of green-field engineering, but frequently they are the product of the evolution of traditional RDBMS-based implementations. In any case, NoSQL databases, endowed with high availability, elasticity and scalability through their easy deployment on cloud-computing platforms, have become an attractive data-storage solution for these big-data applications. Unfortunately, to date, there is little methodological and tool support for migrating existing applications to these new platforms. In this paper, we describe a hybrid architecture for location-aware applications on hierarchical cloud, a methodology for mapping relational (including spatio-temporal) data to HBase, and a process for migrating legacy applications to the new architecture. © 2014 IEEE.

            [description] => In this paper we propose the notion of change metrics, those that measure change in a project or its entities. In particular-we are interested in measuring fine-grained changes, such as those stored by version control systems (such as CVS). A framework for the classification of change metrics is provided. We discuss the idea of change metrics which are modification aware, that is metrics which evaluate the change itself and not just the change in a measurement of the system before and after the change. We then provide examples of the use of these metrics on two mature projects. © 2005 IEEE.

            [description] => Maintainers face the daunting task of wading through a collection of both new and old revisions, trying to ferret out revisions which warrant personal inspection. One can rank revisions by size/lines of code (LOC), but often, due to the distribution of the size of changes, revisions will be of similar size. If we can't rank revisions by LOC perhaps we can rank by Halstead's and McCabe's complexity metrics? However, these metrics are problematic when applied to code fragments (revisions) written in multiple languages: special parsers are required which may not support the language or dialect used; analysis tools may not understand code fragments. We propose using the statistical moments of indentation as a lightweight, language independent, revision/difffriendly metric which uctuully proxies classical complexity metrics. We have extensively evaluated our approach against the entire CVS histories of the 278 of the most popular and most active SourceForge projects. We found that our results are linearly correlated and rank-correlated with traditional measures of complexity, suggesting that measuring indentation is a cheap and accurate proxy for code complexity of revisions. Thus ranking revisions by the standard deviation and summation of indentation will be very similar to ranking revisions by complexity. © 2008 IEEE.

            [description] => CAPTCHAs are automated Turing tests used to determine if the end-user is human and not an automated program. Users are asked to read and answer Visual CAPTCHAs, which often appear as bitmaps of text characters, in order to gain access to a low-cost resource such as webmail or a blog. CAPTCHAs are generated by software and the structure of a CAPTCHA gives hints to its implementation. Thus due to these properties of image processing and image composition, the process that creates CAPTCHAs can often be reverse engineered. Once the implementation strategy of a family of CAPTCHAs has been reverse engineered the CAPTCHA instances may be solved automatically by leveraging weaknesses in the creation process or by comparing a CAPTCHA's output against itself. In this paper, we present a case study where we reverse engineer and solve real-world CAPTCHAs using simple image processing techniques such as bitmap comparison, thresholding, fill-flood segmentation, dilation, and erosion. We present black-box and white-box methodologies for reverse engineering and solving CAPTCHAs. As well we provide an open source toolkit for solving CAPTCHAs that we have used with a success rates of 99, 95, 61, 30%, and 27% on hundreds of CAPTCHAs from five real-world examples. © 2008 IEEE.

            [description] => Often stakeholders, such as developers, managers, or buyers, want to find out what software development processes are being followed within a software project. Their reasons include: CMM and ISO 9000 compliance, process validation, management, acquisitions, and business intelligence. Recovering the software development processes from an existing project is expensive if one must rely upon manual inspection of artifacts and interviews of developers and their managers. Researchers have suggested live observation and instrumentation of a project to allow for more measurement, but this is costly, invasive, and also requires a live running project. Instead, we propose an after the fact analysis: software process recovery. This approach analyzes version control systems, bug trackers and mailing list archives using a variety of supervised and unsupervised techniques from machine learning, topic analysis, natural language processing and statistics. We can combine all of these methods to recover process events that we map back to software development processes like the Unified Process. We can produce diagrams called Recovered Unified Process Views (RUPV) that are similar to the Unified Process diagram, a time-line of effort per parallel discipline occurring across time. We then validate these methods using case studies of multiple open source software systems. © 2010 IEEE.

            [description] => The development process for a given software system is a combination of an idealized, prescribed model and a messy set of ad hoc practices. To some degree, process compliance can be enforced by supporting tools that require various steps be followed in order; however, this approach is often perceived as heavyweight and inflexible by developers, who generally prefer that tools support their desired work habits rather than limit their choices. An alternative approach to monitoring process compliance is to instrument the various tools and repositories that developers use - such as version control systems, bugtrackers, and mailing-list archives - and to build models of the de facto development process through observation, analysis, and inference. In this paper, we present a technique for recovering a project's software development processes from a variety of existing artifacts. We first apply unsupervised and supervised techniques - including word-bags, topic analysis, summary statistics, and Bayesian classifiers - to annotate software artifacts by related topics, maintenance types, and non-functional requirements. We map the analysis results onto a time-line based view of the Unified Process development model, which we call Recovered Unified Process Views. We demonstrate our approach for extracting these process views on two case studies: FreeBSD and SQLite. © 2010 IEEE.

            [description] => Researchers have employed a variety of techniques to extract underlying topics that relate to software development artifacts. Typically, these techniques use semi-unsupervised machine-learning algorithms to suggest candidate word-lists. However, word-lists are difficult to interpret in the absence of meaningful summary labels. Current topic modeling techniques assume manual labelling and do not use domainspecific knowledge to improve, contextualize, or describe results for the developers. We propose a solution: automated labelled topic extraction. Topics are extracted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) from commit-log comments recovered from source control systems such as CVS and Bit-Keeper. These topics are given labels from a generalizable cross-project taxonomy, consisting of non-functional requirements. Our approach was evaluated with experiments and case studies on two large-scale RDBMS projects: MySQL and MaxDB. The case studies show that labelled topic extraction can produce appropriate, context-sensitive labels relevant to these projects, which provides fresh insight into their evolving software development activities. © 2011 ACM.

            [description] => Deployed software systems are typically composed of many pieces, not all of which may have been created by the main development team. Often, the provenance of included components - such as external libraries or cloned source code - is not clearly stated, and this uncertainty can introduce technical and ethical concerns that make it difficult for system owners and other stakeholders to manage their software assets. In this work, we motivate the need for the recovery of the provenance of software entities by a broad set of techniques that could include signature matching, source code fact extraction, software clone detection, call flow graph matching, string matching, historical analyses, and other techniques. We liken our provenance goals to that of Bertillonage, a simple and approximate forensic analysis technique based on bio-metrics that was developed in 19th century France before the advent of fingerprints. As an example, we have developed a fast, simple, and approximate technique called anchored signature matching for identifying library version information within a given Java application. This technique involves a type of structured signature matching performed against a database of candidates drawn from the Maven2 repository, a 150GB collection of open source Java libraries. An exploratory case study using a proprietary e-commerce Java application illustrates that the approach is both feasible and effective. © 2011 ACM.

            [description] => Software clone detection has made substantial progress in the last 15 years, and software clone analysis is starting to provide real insight into how and why code clones are born, evolve, and sometimes die. In this position paper, we make the case that there is a more general problem lurking in the background: software artifact provenance analysis. We argue that determining the origin of software artifacts is an increasingly important problem with many dimensions. We call for simple and lightweight techniques that can be used to help narrow the search space, so that more expensive techniques - including manual examination - can be used effectively on a smaller candidate set. We predict the problem of software provenance will lead towards new avenues of research for the software clones community. © 2011 ACM.

            [description] => Software readability is a property that influences how easily a given piece of code can be read and understood. Since readability can affect maintainability, quality, etc., programmers are very concerned about the readability of code. If automatic readability checkers could be built, they could be integrated into development tool-chains, and thus continually inform developers about the readability level of the code. Unfortunately, readability is a subjective code property, and not amenable to direct automated measurement. In a recently published study, Buse et al. asked 100 participants to rate code snippets by readability, yielding arguably reliable mean readability scores of each snippet; they then built a fairly complex predictive model for these mean scores using a large, diverse set of directly measurable source code properties. We build on this work: we present a simple, intuitive theory of readability, based on size and code entropy, and show how this theory leads to a much sparser, yet statistically significant, model of the mean readability scores produced in Buse's studies. Our model uses well-known size metrics and Halstead metrics, which are easily extracted using a variety of tools. We argue that this approach provides a more theoretically well-founded, practically usable, approach to readability measurement. © 2011 ACM.

            [description] => Software development is difficult to model, particularly the noisy, non-stationary signals of changes per time unit, extracted from version control systems (VCSs). Currently researchers are utilizing timeseries analysis tools such as ARIMA to model these signals extracted from a project's VCS. Unfortunately current approaches are not very amenable to the underlying power-law distributions of this kind of signal. We propose modeling changes per time unit using multifractal analysis. This analysis can be used when a signal exhibits multi-scale self-similarity, as in the case of complex data drawn from power-law distributions. Specifically we utilize multifractal analysis to demonstrate that software development is multifractal, that is the signal is a fractal composed of multiple fractal dimensions along a range of Hurst exponents. Thus we show that software development has multi-scale self-similarity, that software development is multifractal. We also pose questions that we hope multifractal analysis can answer. © 2011 ACM.

            [description] => Inspection is a highly effective but costly technique for quality control. Most companies do not have the resources to inspect all the code; thus accurate defect prediction can help focus available inspection resources. BugCache is a simple, elegant, award-winning prediction scheme that "caches" files that are likely to contain defects [12]. In this paper, we evaluate the utility of BugCache as a tool for focusing inspection, we examine the assumptions underlying BugCache with the aim of improving it, and finally we compare it with a simple, standard bug-prediction technique. We find that BugCache is, in fact, useful for focusing inspection effort; but surprisingly, we find that its performance, when used for inspections, is not much better than a naive prediction model - viz., a model that orders files in the system by their count of closed bugs and chooses enough files to capture 20% of the lines in the system. © 2011 ACM.

            [description] => Software development processes are often viewed as a panacea for software quality: prescribe a process and a quality project will emerge. Unfortunately this has not been the case, as practitioners are prone to push against processes that they do not perceive as helpful, often much to the dismay of stakeholders such as their managers. Yet practitioners still tend to follow some sort of software development processes regardless of the prescribed processes. Thus if a team wants to recover the software development processes of a project or if team is trying to achieve a certification such as ISO9000 or CMM, the team will be tasked with describing their development processes. Previous research has tended to focus on modifying existing projects in order to extract process related information. In contrast, our approach of software process recovery attempts to analyze software artifacts extracted from software repositories in order to infer the underlying software development processes visible within these software repositories. © 2011 IEEE.

            [description] => Clone detection techniques essentially cluster textually, syntactically and/or semantically similar code fragments in or across software systems. For large datasets, similarity identification is costly both in terms of time and memory, and especially so when detecting near-miss clones where lines could be modified, added and/or deleted in the copied fragments. The capability and effectiveness of a clone detection tool mostly depends on the code similarity measurement technique it uses. A variety of similarity measurement approaches have been used for clone detection, including fingerprint based approaches, which have had varying degrees of success notwithstanding some limitations. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of simhash, a state of the art fingerprint based data similarity measurement technique for detecting both exact and near-miss clones in large scale software systems. Our experimental data show that simhash is indeed effective in identifying various types of clones in a software system despite wide variations in experimental circumstances. The approach is also suitable as a core capability for building other tools, such as tools for: incremental clone detection, code searching, and clone management. © 2011 IEEE.

            [description] => There is a perception that when new features are added to a system that those added and modified parts of the source-code are more fault prone. Many have argued that new code and new features are defect prone due to immaturity, lack of testing, as well unstable requirements. Unfortunately most previous work does not investigate the link between a concrete requirement or new feature and the defects it causes, in particular the feature, the changed code and the subsequent defects are rarely investigated. In this paper we investigate the relationship between improvements, new features and defects recorded within an issue tracker. A manual case study is performed to validate the accuracy of these issue types. We combine defect issues and new feature issues with the code from version-control systems that introduces these features, we then explore the relationship of new features with the fault-proneness of their implementations. We describe properties and produce models of the relationship between new features and fault proneness, based on the analysis of issue trackers and version-control systems. We find, surprisingly, that neither improvements nor new features have any significant effect on later defect counts, when controlling for size and total number of changes. © 2011 IEEE.

            [description] => The adoption of distributed version control (DVC ), such as Git and Mercurial, in open-source software (OSS) projects has been explosive. Why is this and how are projects using DVC? This new generation of version control supports two important new features: distributed repositories and histories that preserve branches and merges. Through interviews with lead developers in OSS projects and a quantitative analysis of mined data from the histories of sixty project, we find that the vast majority of the projects now using DVC continue to use a centralized model of code sharing, while using branching much more extensively than before their transition to DVC. We then examine the Linux history in depth in an effort to understand and evaluate how branches are used and what benefits they provide. We find that they enable natural collaborative processes: DVC branching allows developers to collaborate on tasks in highly cohesive branches, while enjoying reduced interference from developers working on other tasks, even if those tasks are strongly coupled to theirs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

            [description] => The fragmentation of the Android ecosystem causes portability and compatibility issues within the entire Android platform, which increases developer workload, delays application deployment, and ultimately disappoints users. This subject is discussed in the press and in scientific publications but it has yet to be systematically examined. The Android bug reports, as submitted by Android-device users, span across operating-system versions and hardware platforms and can provide interesting evidence about the problem. In this paper, we analyze the bug reports related to two popular vendors, HTC and Motorola. First, we manually label the bug reports. Next, we use Labeled-LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) on the labeled data and LDA on the original data, to infer topics. Finally, by examining the relevance of the top 18 bug topics for each vendor's bug reports over time, we classify topics as common or unique (vendor-specific). The latter category constitutes evidence of fragmentation and lack of portability. By comparing Labeled-LDA against LDA, we find that Labeled-LDA produced better, i.e., more feature oriented, topics than LDA. In this paper we find out how fragmentation is manifested within the Android project and we propose a method for tracking fragmentation using feature analysis on project repositories. © 2012 IEEE.

            [description] => Large organizations like Microsoft tend to rely on formal requirements documentation in order to specify and design the software products that they develop. These documents are meant to be tightly coupled with the actual implementation of the features they describe. In this paper we evaluate the value of high-level topic-based requirements traceability in the version control system, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We evaluate LDA topics on practitioners and check if the topics and trends extracted matches the perception that Program Managers and Developers have about the effort put into addressing certain topics. We found that effort extracted from version control that was relevant to a topic often matched the perception of the managers and developers of what occurred at the time. Furthermore we found evidence that many of the identified topics made sense to practitioners and matched their perception of what occurred. But for some topics, we found that practitioners had difficulty interpreting and labelling them. In summary, we investigate the high-level traceability of requirements topics to version control commits via topic analysis and validate with the actual stakeholders the relevance of these topics extracted from requirements. © 2012 IEEE.

            [description] => Experts in software analytics (SA) share their views on what they thought were the most important, or overlooked, aspect of this field. According to Ahmed E. Hassan, NSERC BlackBerry Software Engineering Chair, SA brings the notion of business intelligence to the software industry through fact-based decision support systems. Future SA research must look beyond these mundane tasks for SA to become a powerful, strategic, decision-making instrument. SA needs to service a project's various stakeholders, its marketing, sales, support, and legal teams. Abram Hindle, an assistant professor of computing science at the University of Alberta, sees a future in software analytics where layers of context are taken into consideration. Per Runeson, a professor in software engineering at Lund University, says that the visualization is what will make the software analytics powerful. Sunghum Kim, an assistant professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, says that there is a need to provide the services of information analysts to developers and assist them in making the right decisions.

            [description] => Software repositories provide a deluge of software artifacts to analyze. Researchers have attempted to summarize, categorize, and relate these artifacts by using semi-unsupervised machine-learning algorithms, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA is used for concept and topic analysis to suggest candidate word-lists or topics that describe and relate software artifacts. However, these word-lists and topics are difficult to interpret in the absence of meaningful summary labels. Current attempts to interpret topics assume manual labelling and do not use domain-specific knowledge to improve, contextualize, or describe results for the developers. We propose a solution: automated labelled topic extraction. Topics are extracted using LDA from commit-log comments recovered from source control systems. These topics are given labels from a generalizable cross-project taxonomy, consisting of non-functional requirements. Our approach was evaluated with experiments and case studies on three large-scale Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) projects: MySQL, PostgreSQL and MaxDB. The case studies show that labelled topic extraction can produce appropriate, context-sensitive labels that are relevant to these projects, and provide fresh insight into their evolving software development activities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

            [description] => Deployed software systems are typically composed of many pieces, not all of which may have been created by the main development team. Often, the provenance of included components - such as external libraries or cloned source code - is not clearly stated, and this uncertainty can introduce technical and ethical concerns that make it difficult for system owners and other stakeholders to manage their software assets. In this work, we motivate the need for the recovery of the provenance of software entities by a broad set of techniques that could include signature matching, source code fact extraction, software clone detection, call flow graph matching, string matching, historical analyses, and other techniques. We liken our provenance goals to that of Bertillonage, a simple and approximate forensic analysis technique based on bio-metrics that was developed in 19th century France before the advent of fingerprints. As an example, we have developed a fast, simple, and approximate technique called anchored signature matching for identifying the source origin of binary libraries within a given Java application. This technique involves a type of structured signature matching performed against a database of candidates drawn from the Maven2 repository, a 275 GB collection of open source Java libraries. To show the approach is both valid and effective, we conducted an empirical study on 945 jars from the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, as well as an industrial case study on 81 jars from an e-commerce application. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

            [description] => In the last decade, developers have been increasingly sharing their questions with each other through Question and Answer (Q&A) websites. As a result, these websites have become valuable knowledge repositories, covering a wealth of topics related to particular programming languages. This knowledge is even more useful as the developer community evaluates both questions and answers through a voting mechanism. As votes accumulate, the developer community recognizes reputed members and further trusts their answers. In this paper, we analyze the community's questions and answers to determine the developers' personality traits, using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). We explore the personality traits of Stack Overflow authors by categorizing them into different categories based on their reputation. Through textual analysis of Stack Overflow posts, we found that the top reputed authors are more extroverted compared to medium and low reputed users. Moreover, authors of up-voted posts express significantly less negative emotions than authors of down-voted posts. © 2013 IEEE.

            [description] => Maintainability is a desired property of software, and a variety of metrics have been proposed for measuring it, focusing on different notions of complexity and code readability. Many practices have been proposed to improve maintainability through code refactorings: improving the cohesion, simplification of interfaces, renamings to improve understandability. Code conventions are a body of advice on lexical and syntactic aspects of code, aiming to standardize low-level code design under the assumption that such a systematic approach will make code easier to read, understand, and maintain. We present the first stage in our examination of code-convention adherence practices as a proxy measurement for maintainability. Based on a preliminary survey of software engineers, we identify a set of coding conventions that most relate to maintainability. Then we devise a "convention adherence" metric, based on the number and severity of violations of a defined coding convention. Finally, we analyze several open-source projects according to this metric to better understand how consistent different teams are with respect to adopting and conforming to code conventions. © 2011 IEEE.

            [description] => Software evolution analysis plays an important role in several software engineering activities which are mainly related to maintenance tasks. For this purpose, several approaches and tools have been developed to identify and analyze code changes throughout the history of a software system. However, most existing tools are restricted to a specific type of software artifact, are language-dependent and can only be locally executed on a client machine. To overcome these limitations we propose WebDiff, a web-based generic differencing service for various types of software artifacts including source code and UML diagrams. © 2011 IEEE.

            [description] => Configuration management is a complex task, even for experienced system administrators, which makes self-managing systems a particularly desirable solution. This paper describes a novel contribution to self-managing systems, including an autonomic configuration self-optimization methodology. Our solution involves a systematic simulation method that develops a state-transition model of the behavior of a service-oriented system in terms of its configuration and performance. At run time, the system's behavior is monitored and classified in one of the model states. If this state may lead to futures that violate service level agreements, the system configuration is changed toward a safer future state. Similarly, a satisfactory state that is over-provisioned may be transitioned to a more economical satisfactory state. Aside from the typical benefits of self-optimization, our approach includes an intuitive, explainable decision model, the ability to predict the future with some accuracy avoiding trial-and-error, offline training, and the ability to improve the model at run-time. We demonstrate this methodology in an experiment where Amazon EC2 instances are added and removed to handle changing request volumes to a real service-oriented application. We show that a knowledge base generated entirely in simulation can be used to make accurate changes to a real-world application. © 2011 IEEE.

            [description] => Configuration management is a complex task, even for experienced system administrators, which makes self-managing systems a desirable solution. Self-management implies the need for a model based on which configuration changes may be decided. In previous work, we described a method for constructing a state-transition model of application behavior, by observing the application in simulation. This method relied on an expert to manage the (simulated) application in order to collect the necessary observations for constructing the model. However, that method was agnostic about (a) the size of the system space space as implied by the granularity of the observations, and (b) the sufficiency of the actual observations collected for understanding the application in a variety of configurations and environments. In this paper, we replace the (expensive) expert domain knowledge with automatic approaches to ensuring coverage of the application, and demonstrate the superiority of this approach. We present empirical data regarding state space and granularity to explore the use of state models for understanding applications. © 2011 IEEE.

            [description] => The service-oriented architecture paradigm prescribes the development of systems through the composition of services, i.e., network-accessible components, specified by (and invoked through) their WSDL interface descriptions. Systems thus developed need to be aware of changes in, and evolve with, their constituent services. Therefore, accurate recognition of changes in the WSDL specification of a service is an essential functionality in the context of the software lifecycle of serviceoriented systems. In this work, we present the results of an empirical study on WSDL evolution analysis. In the first part, we empirically study whether VTracker, our algorithm for XML differencing, can precisely recognize changes in WSDL documents by applying it to the task of comparing 18 versions of the Amazon EC2 web service. Second, we analyze the changes that occurred between the subsequent versions of various web-services and discuss their potential effects on the maintainability of service systems relying on them. © 2011 IEEE.

            [description] => Software engineering courses in computer-science departments are meant to prepare students for the practice of designing, developing, understanding and maintaining software in the real world. The effectiveness of these courses have potentially a tremendous impact on the software industry, since it is through these courses that students must learn the state-of-the-art process and the tools of their eventual "trade", so that they can bring this knowledge to their job and thus advance the actual state of practice. The value of "learning software engineering" through project-based courses has long been recognized by educators and practitioners alike. In this paper, we discuss our experience with a distributed project-based course, which infuses the students' learning experience with an increased degree of realism, which, we believe, further improves the quality of their learning and advances their readiness to join the profession. © 2011 ACM.

            [description] => In this paper, we discuss the most recent coordination extension to the PicOS-tuples environment, inspired, to a degree, by B-Threads and FACTS. We illustrate the extensions with two design patterns, highly useful in WSN computations, known as regulative superimposition and distributed detection. Those patterns are employed in a debugging protocol that retrieves snapshots of node states. We demonstrate how our new idioms can be propitious for separating concerns in WSN programming using tuples. © 2011 ACM.

            [description] => The term "Smart Home" refers to a home that has both a set of sensors to observe the environment and a set of actuators to automatically control home devices to improve the occupants' experience. A Smart Home has the potential to provide a variety of services based on information gleaned by data recorded by a multiplicity of sensor types, but also requires a systematic means (a) of abstracting differences among sensor types and (b) of supporting services and their rapid development. In this paper, we describe our approach towards meeting those needs, including a component of sensor adapters and a language for modeling person activities that can guide the development of health-care services. © 2011 ACM.

            [description] => Simulation-based training has been an integral part of health-sciences education for many years, and is becoming increasingly important with the shift towards competency-based education. Virtual worlds have emerged as an effective way to deliver realistic, collaborative training in complex processes, which is consistent with competency-based training and assessment. We have developed MeRiTS, a virtual world-based platform for creating training simulations, to provide students in a wide range of disciplines with this kind of training. Furthermore, through these student training experiences, we will be able to provide a rigorous, comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of conducting scenario-based training in virtual worlds. In this paper, we briefly present the MeRiTS architecture, and the underlying theories, components and models that support the system. We then present a detailed description of our most mature scenario, which trains paramedics in proper rescue and patient handoff procedures. We also provide an in-depth discussion of the development process for this scenario, and conclude with some lessons learned from the experience. © 2011 ACM.

            [description] => Software development is fundamentally a collaborative task. Developers, sometimes geographically distributed, collectively work on different parts of a project. The challenge of ensuring that their contributions consistently build on one another is a major concern for collaborative development and implies concerns with effective communication, task administration and exchange of documents and information concerning the project. In this demo, we present WikiDev 2.0, a lightweight wiki-based tool suite that enhances collaboration within software development teams. WikiDev 2.0 integrates information from multiple development tools and displays the results through its wikibased front-end. The tool also offers several analysis techniques and visualizations that improve the project-status awareness of the team. © 2010 IEEE.

            [description] => Software teams, as they communicate throughout the life-cycle of their projects, generate a substantial stream of textual data. Through emails and chats, developers discuss the requirements of their software system, they negotiate the distribution of tasks among them, and they make decisions about the system design, and the internal structure and functionalities of its code modules. The software research community has long recognized the importance and potential usefulness of such textual information. In this paper, we discuss our recent work on systematically analyzing several textual streams collected through our WikiDev2.0 tool. We use two different text-analysis methods to examine five different sources of textual data. We report on our experience using our method on analyzing the communications of a nine-member team over four months. © 2010 IEEE.

            [description] => Several types of 3D software visualizations have been developed to communicate information about the products of a software project and, sometimes, the development process itself. These visualizations have been limited in the degree of interactivity they enabled (primarily panning and zooming) and in their accessibility (since in most cases they assumed a particular client platform). In this paper we discuss our 3D visualization of the data collected and extracted in our collaborative software-development platform WikiDev2.0, developed in the Open Wonderland virtual world. The visualization adopts a city metaphor, similar to earlier work, but advances the state of the art by providing a web-accessible distributed 3D environment where multiple users can explore the same project. In this paper we discuss this visualization, which we call WikiDev3D, and we report on our preliminary findings about its effectiveness against the more traditional visualization of the original WikiDev2.0 tool. © 2010 IEEE.

            [description] => Virtual worlds, where thousands of people can interact simultaneously within the same simulated three-dimensional space, represent a frontier in social computing with critical implications for business, education, social sciences, technological sciences, and our society at large. Members participate in virtual worlds through graphical representations of themselves, i.e., their avatars. In a virtual world, through their avatars users can engage in rich interactions with each other and with their environment. They can build objects and they can exchange them for in-world money, sometimes exchangeable with real money. They can communicate through voice over a headset and microphone, they can use text chat, and they can communicate non-verbally with their avatars' gestures. They can navigate through the world by walking, running, driving vehicles, flying, and teleporting. All in all, they can "experience" the world through a rich variety of interactions with it, including dressing, changing their avatars' shapes, touching things, building and owning things, engaging in quests, doing sports, communicating, socializing and collaborating. This rich experience and the increased degree of immersion and engagement it enables create an opportunity for software systems that enable new forms of system-user interaction.

            [description] => The task of programming sensor-based systems comes with severe constraints on the resources, typically memory, CPU power, and energy. The challenge is usually addressed with techniques that result in poor code understandability and maintainability. In this paper, we report on a data centric language extension based on a tuple-space abstraction, akin to Linda [2], applied to PicOS [5], a programming environment for wireless sensor networks (WSN's). The extension improves state and context management in a multi-tasking environment suffering from severe memory limitations. The solution integrates tuple operations into the model - for networking, event handling, and thread contexts. We demonstrate how tuple constructs improve coding and reduce code overhead. We also show how thread's context-tuples can be used as interface arguments for extension by modular aspect constructs.

            [description] => Text analysis is an important computational task, as unstructured data including text abound and can potentially provide interesting information and knowledge in a variety of areas. In our collaboration with Digital Humanists, we have started to examine the opportunities that the cloud offers to improving the response times of text-analysis tools so that users can comparatively analyze large text corpora across a variety of dimensions. To that end, we have started migrating existing text analysis tools to the cloud, beginning with TAPoR, the Text Analysis Portal for Research. In this paper, we discuss our experience redesigning and re-implementing four basic TAPoR operations on Hadoop and we report on the performance improvements enabled by the migration. © 2010 IEEE.

            [description] => Becoming a skilled professional requires the acquisition of theoretical knowledge and the practice of skills under the guidance of an expert. The idea of learning-through-apprenticeship is long accepted in medicine and, more generally, in the health sciences, where practicum courses are an essential part of most curricula. Because of the high cost of apprenticeship programs - mentors can usually supervise few trainees and trainees may need long apprenticeship periods - simulation has long been adopted as a learning-by-doing training method that can supplement apprenticeship in many professional and engineering programs, including the health sciences. In this paper, we describe our experience developing virtual world-based training systems for two healthcare contexts. In one, procedural training was emphasized, while the other focused on teaching communication skills. In each case, we developed a custom set of tools to meet the needs of that context. We present an analysis of the case studies, and lessons drawn from this analysis. Copyright 2010 ACM.

            [description] => Communication plays a vital role throughout all the activities of software engineering processes. As Web 2.0 paradigms concentrate on communication, collaboration, and information sharing, it is only natural that these applications should become part of the software engineering toolkit. In this paper, we describe Annoki, our collaboration platform built on top of the popular wiki software MediaWiki. Annoki supports collaboration by improving the organization of, managing access to, assisting in the creation of, and graphically displaying information about content stored on the wiki. We follow our description of Annoki with a discussion of the current users of Annoki, the largest of whom is the Software Engineering Research Lab at the University of Alberta, where it is used to manage research and development software engineering activities on a daily basis. © 2010 ACM.

            [description] => Social network analysis aims at uncovering and understanding the structures and patterns resulting from social interactions among individuals and organizations engaged in a common activity. Since the early days of the field, networks are modeled as graphs modeling social actors and the relations between them. The field has become very active with the maturity of computational machinery to handle large-scale graphs, and, more recently, the automated gathering of social data. We introduce ReaSoN: a comprehensive set of tools for visualizing and exploring social networks resulting from academic research. In doing so, ReaSoN contributes to the understanding as well as fostering of the social networks underlying academic research. We describe the infrastructure, visualizations and analysis provided in our system, as well as the process of extracting the social networks which are latent in bibliographic and citation databases.

            [description] => Most software development today is a team activity. Project team members collaboratively work on the tasks necessary to accomplish the various project milestones. The work is usually asynchronous, not orchestrated by any explicit workflow, sometimes geographically distributed, and involves the use of a variety of tools, which do not always interoperate. Version-control repositories are essential in supporting this collaboration but cannot satisfactorily address the problem of traceability of interdependencies among the artifacts produced by the individual tools. In the WikiDev 2.0 collaboration tool, we propose to address these problems by adopting a wiki as the central platform in which to integrate information about the various artifacts of interest, to cluster this information in clusters of relevant artifacts, and to present views on this information that cut across the individual tool boundaries. In this paper, we discuss the central clustering algorithm in WikiDev 2.0 and we evaluate its effectiveness with a case study.

            [description] => Enterprises are increasingly adopting Web Services as an enterprise-application development platform, I motivated primarily by the large-scale language and platform interoperability the standards enable and the variety of tools supporting the development of systems of services. However, SOA is underutilized as a distributed-application platform when it is used only to specify service compositions (i.e., data and control dependencies among the service operations) in an executable language (such as BPEL), expose them as new complex services and have them orchestrated by an execution engine at runtime. A fundamental innovation of SOA (and Web Services) is that it makes explicit the concept of, "service choreography", that is; the coordination of the interactions between two or more independent parties, where no single party can assume complete control of the overall process. Note that in contrast, the concept of, "service orchestration", assumes that there is such a single overarching authority. This concept of choreography admits that in SOAs there are multiple independent interacting partners and there is no single central point of control for the runtime behavior of the overall system. Without support for true choreographies, SOAs simply support intra-organization software distribution and integration - choreography support is necessary for interorganization software composition and innovative service provision. © Copyright held by author.

            [description] => The wide adoption of service orientation and the growing complexity of service-oriented applications presents new challenges in configuring and tuning these applications, both at deployment time and at run time. This paper describes our simulation-based approach to addressing this problem. We have developed a general SOA simulation framework, which includes a tool for automatically generating significant portions of the simulator based on the WSDLs of the web services. Our methodology stipulates the systematic exploration of varying SOA deployment configurations in order to collect behavioral profiles. One can use these to examine the trade-offs between configuration cost and performance, ultimately identifying a cost-effective configuration that complies with a Service Level Agreement. The results can also used to identify configurations that allow for more accurate load-balancing and thus better overall performance. We evaluated our approach on a service-oriented text analysis toolkit. We show that our simulation results, produced by automatically generated code with minor manual changes, match real-world response-time metrics. Given these promising early results we describe future uses of our methodology. Copyright 2009 ACM.

            [description] => Providing affordable, high-quality healthcare to the elderly while enabling them to live independently longer is of critical importance, as this is an increasing and expensive demographic to treat. Sensor-network technologies are essential to developing assisted living environments. In our Smart Condo project, we have deployed a sensor network with a variety of sensor types in an 850 square-foot condominium. The sensor network records a variety of events and environmental parameters and feeds the related data into our web-based system. This system is responsible for inferring higher-order information about the activities of the condo's occupant and supporting the visualization of the collected information in a 2D Geographic Information System (GIS) and a 3D virtual world, namely Second Life (SL). © 2009 IEEE.

            [description] => Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) are being increasingly adopted for the development of distributed applications that involve multiple partner organizations. The main challenge in configuring such applications - whether autonomously or manually - is meeting the service quality expected by the consumers. In this paper, we describe a methodology and corresponding tool implementation for estimating the capacity of alternative configurations of complex service-oriented applications. We use a sophisticated enterprise application with many possible configurations as our test application. The current tool prototype simulates the behavior of the application for a given configuration on an existing network topology. This simulation is relatively coarse-grained, but is capable of tracking several performance indicators. We evaluate this simulation output against actual performance data.

            [description] => With the explosion of Web 2.0 ideas and technologies such as XML, REST, and RIAs (Rich Internet Applications), developers are now creating "mashup" applications that aggregate numerous sources of information and promote rich user interaction. Although many innovative mashups are being created, there has been little research systematically examining which technologies to use and how to design and implement such applications. We describe the features and complexity inherent within a data-intensive, REST-based, RIA entitled, Invenio. Invenio combines a variety of different technologies (Yahoo! Maps, Amazon Associates Web Service, REST, and the Flex framework) to geographically visualize aggregated music chart information. We report on our experiences in designing and authoring Invenio, use Invenio's requirements as a case study to examine relevant technologies and recommend a set of possible "best practices" for developing other RIAs.

            [description] => The combination of realistic virtual environments and product information offers a compelling new medium for consumers to shop for products. Specifically, by combining the experience of exploring a virtual house with retail information on items in that house, a consumer can virtually populate a house with desired items. This is particularly appealing for people, such as a couple getting married, who are looking to furnish an entire house with newly-purchased items. The system proposed in this paper provides this combination of realistic, 3D visualization and detailed product information. It uses Second Life to provide the realistic user interface, and a REST-style web-based application to create connections between this platform and publicly-available retailer APIs. In cases where a retailer API is unavailable, HTML wrapping may be used to obtain equivalent information. The economic viability of the concept is examined through a business case study. © 2008 IEEE.

            [description] => Use case re-documentation is an important maintenance task. The implemented functionality of an application may not reflect original use cases. This discrepancy can create problems in downstream, software activities, such as developing documentation and migrating to platforms adopting a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). We present a methodology and a toolkit for redocumenting the use cases of interactive Java Swing object-oriented applications. Our method collects execution traces of the application while experienced users interact with it. These traces are clustered according to the similarity of the user interface events, to identify families of task-specific execution scenarios. Finally, the traces in each cluster are aligned to produce usage scenarios and visualized. © 2008 IEEE.

            [description] => Platform migration is a core problem in software reengineering, since applications are frequently deemed useful in environments other than the ones in which they were originally implemented. The World-Wide-Web in particular is becoming a target platform of choice because of its pervasiveness, and a substantial class of applications that could benefit from migration to the web is that of Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) desktop applications. To that end, we have recently developed Swing2Script, an interaction-reengineering approach for automatically migrating Java-Swing applications to Ajax-enabled web-based applications. The approach reverse engineers the structure and behavior of Java Swing GUIs, using aspects woven unobtrusively in the original application. Based on the extracted model, it automatically builds an Ajax-enabled front end, which drives the relevant workflows of the original application. In this paper, we describe our migration approach and the middleware on which it relies, and we illustrate it with a case study.

            [description] => Our work examines the problem of estimating the potential business value of evolving service-oriented applications, based on the value of the new services this evolution is anticipated to enable and the estimated cost of the development effort. We have adopted COCOMO II as the software-development cost model, as it is designed to account for evolutionary software development. However, it is clear that the model will have to be extended in order to represent the particular idiosyncrasies of this new development style. As it is, it can estimate the cost of adapting source code; however, SOA development also involves developing and adapting declarative composition specifications, which may be a fundamentally different process. Specifically, research into the cost of creating a web service composition is required. We have also adopted real-option theory for modeling the business services that can be delivered based on an envisioned service-oriented application. Our intuition is that the fundamentally compositional nature of service-oriented development comes with the built-in advantage of enabling interesting evolution at the design level (as opposed to the code level). Therefore, we believe that there is a very direct mapping between the design-evolution potential of a service-oriented application and the business services that it can support in the future. Consequently, we hope to develop a real-option model grounded to the SOA development process. Along these lines, we are developing a tool to assist in this research. The tool will help the user to reason financially about a proposed change to a web service, constructing a fairly complete view of the situation and the possible futures associated with it. Traditionally, the value of a software service has been determined solely by the business community, with only the occasional regard for the possible value of flexibility. Conversely, the cost of developing software has been studied extensively by the computing science community. This work is an attempt to further join these two fields for a more complete view of web-service econometrics. © 2007 IEEE.

            [description] => Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) supports the encapsulation of concerns cutting across the logical design of object-oriented software, by introducing aspects as a new unit of code. Code fragments, defined within aspects, such as advice or inter-type declarations, can be composed together with traditional system units, such as classes in OO code, using quantification expressions that specify where such fragments are to be injected and executed. The introduction of aspect-orientation in object-oriented software development raises two interesting comprehension questions. First, is the comprehension of AO software more difficult than traditional object-oriented software? Second, can aspects support comprehension tasks of object-oriented developers? © 2007 IEEE.

            [description] => The blogging phenomenon has caught the on-line world by surprise; the number of blogs doubles regularly and the number of daily blog entries seems to also continuously increase. Even more interestingly, blogs seem to compete with authoritative media outlets as a means for delivering news and opinions. The perceived power of blogs to inform and form, public opinion has given rise to several blog-mining services analyzing the blog entries to infer the reputation of their customers. In this paper, we discuss our work on visualizing and systematically analyzing several blogs in the same domain of interest (movies) in order to assess to what extent the "buzz" of blogs correlates with public opinion.

            [description] => Refactoring is an important activity in the evolutionary development of object-oriented software systems. Yet, several questions about the practice of refactoring remain unanswered, such as what fraction of code modifications are refactorings and what are the most frequent types of refactorings. To gain some insight in this matter, we conducted a detailed case study on the structural evolution of Eclipse, an integrated-development environment (IDE) and a plugin-based framework. Our study indicates that 1) about 70% of structural changes may be due to refactorings; 2) for about 60% of these changes, the references to the affected entities in a component-based application can be automatically updated by a refactoring-migration tool if the relevant information of refactored components can be gathered through the refactoring engine; and 3) state-of-the-art IDEs, such as Eclipse, support only a subset of commonly applied low-level refactorings and lack support for more complex ones, which are also frequent. Based on our findings, we draw some conclusions on high-level design requirements for a refactoring-based development environment. © 2006 IEEE.

            [description] => To date, research on web-service discovery has followed the tradition of signature matching based on the interface description captured in WSDL. WSDL specifications, however, can be information poor, with basic data types, and unintuitive identifiers for data, messages and operations. The nature of the usage of the WSDL component in the context of a BPEL composition can be an extremely useful source of information in the context of service discovery. In this paper, we discuss our method for service discovery based on both interface and usage matching, exploiting the information captured in the WSDL and BPEL specifications. Our approach views both WSDL and BPEL as hierarchical structures and uses tree alignment to compare them. We illustrate our method with an example scenario. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

            [description] => Refactoring is an important activity in the evolutionary development of object-oriented software systems. Several IDEs today support the automated application of some refactorings; at the same time, there is substantial on-going research aimed at developing support for deciding when and how software should be refactored and for estimating the effect of the refactoring on the quality requirements of the software. On the other hand, understanding the refactorings in the evolutionary history of a software system is essential in understanding its design rationale. Yet, only very limited support exists for detecting refactorings. In this paper, we present our approach for detecting refactorings by analyzing the system evolution at the design level. We evaluate our method with case studies, examining two realistic examples of object-oriented software. © 2006 IEEE.

            [description] => This paper presents UMLDiff, an algorithm for automatically detecting structural changes between the designs of subsequent versions of object-oriented software. It takes as input two class models of a Java software system, reverse engineered from two corresponding code versions. It produces as output a change tree, i.e., a tree of structural changes, that reports the differences between the two design versions in terms of (a) additions, removals, moves, renamings of packages, classes, interfaces, fields and methods, (b) changes to their attributes, and (c) changes of the dependencies among these entities. UMLDiff produces an accurate report of the design evolution of the software system, and enables subsequent design-evolution analyses from multiple perspectives in support of various evolution activities. UMLDiff and the analyses it enables can assist software engineers in their tasks of understanding the rationale of design evolution of the software system and planning future development and maintenance activities. We evaluate UMLDiff's correctness and robustness through a real-world case stud. Copyright 2005 ACM.

            [description] => Organizations that own web services participating in a workflow composition may evolve their components independently. Service coordination can fail when previously legal messages between independently changing, distributed components become illegal because their respective workflow models are no longer synchronized. This paper presents an intelligent-agent framework that wraps a web service in a conversation layer and a simple workflow-adaptation function. The conversation layer implements protocols and consults globally shared, declarative policy specifications to resolve interaction failures. The framework allows agents to resolves various model mismatches that cause interaction errors, including changes to required preconditions, partners, and expected message ordering. Implications of this distributed approach to web service coordination are also discussed. © 2005 IEEE.

            [description] => Service-oriented architecture is emerging as a compelling paradigm for developing web-based software applications. In this style, the functional components of the system are implemented in various programming languages as network-accessible "services" declaratively specified (in WSDL) and declaratively composed in workflows (using BPEL4WS). Despite this fundamentally distributed conceptualization of service composition, most current middleware assumes that the specification of the service composition is interpreted at run time by a central middleware node. This implies inflexible composition evolution: all parties must be updated concurrently to avoid interaction failures. This paper introduces an intelligent-agent framework that wraps web services in a conversation layer and is capable of a simple workflow-adaptation function. The conversation layer implements protocols and consults globally shared, declarative policy specifications to resolve conversation failures. Two case studies illustrate this approach.

            [description] => Object-oriented software is usually developed through evolutionary processes. To consistently evolve a system, developers have to understand the rationale behind its current design and the evolution trajectory that has led to it. In this paper, we present a method for analyzing the design evolution of object-oriented software systems, for the purpose of providing relevant advice to developers. This method relies on UMLDiff, a heuristic UML-structure differencing algorithm, which, given a sequence of UML class models corresponding to the logical design of a sequence of system code versions, produces a sequence of "change trees" that describe the design-level structural changes between subsequent system versions. A set of design-evolution patterns are then analyzed to understand the rationale underlying design decisions that may affect the software system. We demonstrate how the recovered knowledge provides the basis for mentoring the developers on future maintenance activities. © 2005 IEEE.

            [description] => Recognizing the differences between subsequent versions of HTML documents is an important problem. It is useful for managers of multi-authored web sites who need to review and approve the changes to their web-site content. It is also necessary for users who want to be able to easily recognize changes to the pages they visit regularly. Comparing HTML documents at the lexical level, as if they were regular text documents, is neither informative nor intuitive. Instead, their internal tree structure has to be taken into account. In this paper, we discuss VDiff, an algorithm we have developed for HTML differencing, based on the Zhang-Shasha tree-edit distance algorithm. Our algorithm reports which nodes in the two compared documents match, have been deleted(inserted) from(in) the original(subsequent) document, or have been, moved in the HTML structure. We have evaluated the accuracy and performance of our algorithm with a case study. © 2005 IEEE.

            [description] => The success of a software development project depends on the technical competency of the development team, the quality of the tools they use, and the project-management decisions they make during the software lifecycle. Instructors of software-engineering courses that involve small project teams are often overwhelmed with the task of monitoring the progress of multiple teams. Without adequate monitoring and advice on best practices, problems in the team's process or the developed product may go unnoticed until it is too late to be easily fixed. This paper introduces the JRefleX environment, with components built upon Eclipse, to support the education of small software teams.

            [description] => As software systems age, the requirements that motivated their original development get lost. Requirements documentation is unavailable or obsolete. Recapturing these requirements is critical for software reengineering activities. In our CelLEST process we adopt a data-mining approach to this problem and attempt to discover patterns of frequent similar episodes in the sequential run-time traces of the legacy user-interface behavior. These patterns constitute operational models of the application's functional requirements, from the end-user perspective. We have developed an algorithm, IPM, for interaction-pattern discovery. This algorithm discovers patterns that meet a user-specified criterion and is robust to insertion errors, caused by user mistakes or by the availability of alternative scenarios for the same user task. In this paper, we discuss IPM and we evaluate it with a case study. Copyright 2002 ACM.

            [description] => The specification of generic Problem-Solving Methods has been a fertile research area. A lot of work has been devoted to developing languages for describing PSMs, identifying PSMs, and using their specifications for requirements capture, design and development of knowledge based systems. In our work, we have been investigating another potential use for PSMs, namely, supporting the redesign of systems that fail to exhibit the behaviours desired of them, that is, behaviours similar to, but slightly different from, the ones they were originally designed to exhibit. To this end, we have defined a PSM modeling language and a failure-driven redesign process based on this language, both of which were implemented in the AUTOGNOSTIC system. In this paper, we report on a sequence of experiments performed with AUTOGNOSTIC. Some of them were exploratory and their goal was to enable the precise characterization of issues relating to the problem of system redesign, while others were designed to evaluate the PSM language and the redesign process implemented in AUTOGNOSTIC.
