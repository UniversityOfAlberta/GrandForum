<p>The UBC Contraception Access Research Team-Groupe de recherche sur l’accessibilité à la contraception (CART-GRAC), developed and maintains this site to both support the practice of Mifepristone providers across Canada, and to collect information about facilitators and barriers to practice. In addition to sharing best practices among practitioners, we aim to use information or any challenges you face and work with the health service leaders to address these barriers.</p>
