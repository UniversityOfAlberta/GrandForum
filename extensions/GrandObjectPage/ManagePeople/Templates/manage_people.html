<p>
    You can use the table below to manage people on the Forum.  By default you will see people in the table if they meet any one of the following conditions:
    <ul>
        <li>The member is yourself</li>
        <li>You supervise the member</li>
        <li>You have a 'Works With' relation with that member</li>
        <li>You are the project leader of a project that the member is on</li>
    </ul>
    If you would like to manage additional people who already exist on the Forum, then you can add them by clicking the 'Edit Existing Member' button.  If the person does not exist, then you will need to add them by clicking the 'Add New Member' button.
