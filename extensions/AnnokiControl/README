This extension controls all other Annoki-related extensions (allows
for enabling and disabling, and manages dependencies between
extensions).  Handles loading of other Annoki extensions so no other
changes to LocalSettings.php are needed.

Installation:

Add the following line to LocalSettings.php:
require_once("$IP/extensions/AnnokiControl/AnnokiControl.php");
