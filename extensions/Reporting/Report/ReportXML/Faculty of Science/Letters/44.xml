                        {if("{get(length)}" == "6 months", {get(start6)})}

                    was recommended for approval by the FEC; however, higher-ranked applications received first approval which has resulted in the Faculty reaching maximum quota and your application not being approved.

                <p>You are encouraged to apply for sabbatical again. Should you choose to do so, please ensure your application is submitted by {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, FOLLOWUP_DATE, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}.</p>
