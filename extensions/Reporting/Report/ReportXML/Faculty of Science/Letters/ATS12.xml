                <p>Each year, the Academic Teaching Staff Evaluation Committee (ATSEC) is charged with the responsibility of awarding merit increments to its Academic Teaching Staff, from an increment pool that is currently equal to 1.2 times the number of eligible staff within the Faculty of Science.</p>
                
                <p>As per Article D7 of Schedule D, I am informing you that at its meeting of February 27, {$next_year}, the ATSEC did not support the recommendation of a {getText(RP_CHAIR, FEC_REVIEW, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 0, 0)} increment made by your Department Chair and instead, is prepared to award an increment of {getText(RP_FEC_TABLE, TABLE, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}. The Chair {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, CHAIR_POSITION, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}. Under Article D6 of Schedule D this becomes the preliminary position of ATSEC. This decision was based on the following: </p>

                <ul><li>{getText({$report_type}, TABLE, COMMENT, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}</li></ul><br />

                You may wish to consider the following options:
                <ul>
                    <li>I am offering to meet with you during the week of {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, FOLLOWUP_DATE, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} to discuss your individual case as it was presented before ATSEC. Please email sciea@ualberta.ca for an appointment.</li>
                    <li>As per Article D7, you have the right to request reconsideration of the ATSECâ€™s preliminary decision by informing me, in writing, within 5 working days from the receipt of this letter.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Should you have any procedural questions, please contact sciea@ualberta.ca.</p>
