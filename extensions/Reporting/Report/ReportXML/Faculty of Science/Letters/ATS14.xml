                <p>This is to inform you that the Academic Teaching Staff Evaluation Committee (ATSEC) has approved the award of a {getText(RP_FEC_TABLE, TABLE, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} merit increment for you, rather than the {getText(RP_CHAIR, FEC_REVIEW, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 0, 0)} merit increment recommended by your Department Chair.</p>

                <p>Each year, the ATSEC is charged with the responsibility of awarding merit increments to its academic teaching staff, from an increment pool that is currently equal to 1.2 times the number of eligible staff within the Faculty. This decision was made within this context. This increment takes effect July 1, 2023.</p>

                <p>ATSEC would like to thank you for your contributions to the Faculty in the past year and wishes you well in the coming year.</p>
