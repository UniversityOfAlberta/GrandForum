                <p>This is to inform you that the Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) at its meeting held on December 2 - 6 did not support your Department Chairâ€™s recommendation that you be awarded tenure. Instead, you will be granted a second probationary period in accordance with Article A5.03.4(a) of Schedule A. This decision is final and binding.</p>
                
                <p>In accordance with the provisions of Article A5.02.8 of Schedule A, your second probationary appointment will be for the two-year period July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2027. Your appointment will be governed by the Common Agreement and Schedule A, as amended from time to time.</p>
                
                <p>Under Article A6.03.9 of Schedule A, the standards for the award of tenure and concurrent designation as associate professor applicable to you shall not be changed unless you have agreed to the change. I encourage you to remain familiar with the standards for tenure and promotion of the Faculty and understand the expectations of your Department Chair.</p>
