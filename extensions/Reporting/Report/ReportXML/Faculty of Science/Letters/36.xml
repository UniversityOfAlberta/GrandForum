                <p>This is to inform you that the Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) has approved the award of a {getText(RP_FEC_TABLE, TABLE, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} incrementation for you, rather than the {getText(RP_CHAIR, FEC_REVIEW, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 0, 0)} incrementation recommended by your Department Chair.</p>
                
                <p>Each year, the FEC is charged with the responsibility of awarding incrementation to its faculty, from an increment pool that is currently equal to 1.2 x the number of eligible staff within the Faculty. This decision was made within the context of the relative performance of your colleagues of similar rank.</p>
                
                <p>FEC would like to thank you for your contributions to the Faculty in the past year and wishes you well in the coming year.</p>
