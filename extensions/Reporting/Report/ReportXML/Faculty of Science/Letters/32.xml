                <p>Each year, the Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) is charged with the responsibility of awarding incrementation to its faculty, from an increment pool that is currently equal to 1.2 x the number of eligible staff within the Faculty.</p>
                
                At its meeting of {getText(RP_LETTER, TABLE, DATE, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}, the FEC supported the recommendation of a {getText(RP_CHAIR, FEC_REVIEW, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 0, 0)} increment made by your Department Chair. This decision was based on the following: 
                <ul><li>{getText(RP_LETTER, TABLE, COMMENT, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}</li></ul><br />

                <p>Since you chose to appear before FEC to {getText(RP_LETTER, TABLE, PRESENT_CASE, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}, as per Article A6.16.8 of Schedule A, you have the right to appeal this decision to the General Appeals Committee (GAC) under Article A8.03.1 of Schedule A. A request must be made to the Chair of the GAC (Provost, cc’d to Faculty Relations), in writing, within 10 working days from the receipt of the letter confirming FEC’s decision.</p>
                
                <p>It is advisable that you consult the Association of Academic Staff University of Alberta (AASUA) for advice.</p>
                
                <p>Should you have any procedural questions, please contact the Secretary to FEC, Lori Dammann-Thomson, at 780-492-6232 or sciea@ualberta.ca.</p>
