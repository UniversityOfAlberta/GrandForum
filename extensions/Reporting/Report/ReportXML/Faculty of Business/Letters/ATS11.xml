                <p>Each year, the Academic Teaching Staff Evaluation Committee (ATSEC) is charged with the responsibility of awarding merit increments to its Academic Teaching Staff, from an increment pool that is currently equal to 1.2 times the number of eligible staff within the Faculty of Science.</p>
                
                <p>I am writing to inform you that the ATSEC has accepted the recommendation of your Department Chair and has awarded you a merit increment of {getText(RP_CHAIR, FEC_REVIEW, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 0, 0)} in recognition of your achievements during the past evaluation period. The award takes effect on July 1, {$next_year}.</p>

                <p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your work this past year, and to wish you continued success in your teaching.</p>
                
                <p>Should you have any procedural questions, please contact sciea@ualberta.ca.</p>
