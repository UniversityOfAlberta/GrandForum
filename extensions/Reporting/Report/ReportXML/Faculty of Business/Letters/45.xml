                    This is to inform you that your application for a {replace(months, month, {get(length)})} sabbatical from 
                        {if("{get(length)}" == "6 months", {get(start6)})}
                        {if("{get(length)}" == "12 months", {date_format({strtotime({get(start12)})})})} 
                    to 
                        {if("{get(length)}" == "6 months", {get(end6)})}
                        {if("{get(length)}" == "12 months", {get(end12)})}
                    was not recommended for approval by the FEC. The FEC had the following concerns:
                </p>
                <p>{getText({$report_type}, TABLE, COMMENTS, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}</p>
            
                <p>Your application has been denied as it was found not to be meritorious and of mutual advantage to you and the University. Should you choose to apply for a sabbatical again, I encourage you to address the concerns identified by the FEC. Sabbatical applications are to be submitted by {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, FOLLOWUP_DATE, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}.</p>
