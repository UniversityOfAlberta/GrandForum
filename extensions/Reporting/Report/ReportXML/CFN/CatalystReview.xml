                    <li>Goal of the Competition: The Catalyst Program supports novel/innovative pilot, feasibility, and/or translational studies.  Proposals must demonstrate future scalability by providing a description of future plans to implement the study across Canada in a future grant submission. It is expected that successful Catalyst grants will be suitable for future larger scale CFN funding opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Observational studies or studies that do not study the impact of interventions will not be funded.</li>
                    <li>When reviewing/scoring grants please consider that the applicant's were informed that proposals will be judged on the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Proposals need to demonstrate the potential that results would be recognized nationally and globally for scientific excellence.</li>
                            <li>Proposals should have clearly defined research question(s) and knowledge or practice gap(s) for the care of frail elderly Canadians</li>
                            <li>Each proposal must include the evaluation of one or more: i) patient-centred outcomes, ii) patient/family satisfaction or iii) health economic outcomes</li>
                            <li>Proposals must have a well described methodology and must demonstrate that key deliverables and measurable outcomes are achievable within the funding period</li>
                            <li>Project team members will be adjudicated for their level of experience and expertise.  Where appropriate, proposals must include a health economist and/or ethicist on the project team</li>
                            <li>Degree to which projects have high translational capacity towards improving care for frail elderly Canadians. </li>
                            <li>Budget: Maximum $100,00 over a maximum period of 1 year.</li>

                    <li>Goal of the Competition: The Catalyst Program supports novel/innovative pilot, feasibility, and/or translational studies.  Proposals must demonstrate future scalability by providing a description of future plans to implement the study across Canada in a future grant submission. It is expected that successful Catalyst grants will be suitable for future larger scale CFN funding opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Observational studies or studies that do not study the impact of interventions will not be funded.</li>
                    <li>When reviewing/scoring grants please consider that the applicant's were informed that proposals will be judged on the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Proposals need to demonstrate the potential that results would be recognized nationally and globally for scientific excellence.</li>
                            <li>Proposals should have clearly defined research question(s) and knowledge or practice gap(s) for the care of frail elderly Canadians</li>
                            <li>Each proposal must include the evaluation of one or more: i) patient-centred outcomes, ii) patient/family satisfaction or iii) health economic outcomes</li>
                            <li>Proposals must have a well described methodology and must demonstrate that key deliverables and measurable outcomes are achievable within the funding period</li>
                            <li>Project team members will be adjudicated for their level of experience and expertise.  Where appropriate, proposals must include a health economist and/or ethicist on the project team</li>
                            <li>Degree to which projects have high translational capacity towards improving care for frail elderly Canadians. </li>
                            <li>Budget: Maximum $100,00 over a maximum period of 1 year.</li>

            <![CDATA[
                <ol>
                    <li>Please complete all sections.</li>
                    <li>Goal of the Competition: The Catalyst Program supports novel/innovative pilot, feasibility, and/or translational studies.  Proposals must demonstrate future scalability by providing a description of future plans to implement the study across Canada in a future grant submission. It is expected that successful Catalyst grants will be suitable for future larger scale CFN funding opportunities.</li>
                    <li>When reviewing/scoring grants please consider that the applicant's were informed that proposals will be judged on the following:</li>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Investigator will need to map out how the current and future research plans will help accelerate improvement in care for frail elderly Canadians and their caregivers, and provide a socio-economic benefit for Canada.  Observational studies or studies that do not study the impact of interventions will not be funded.</li>
                        <li>Research projects must fit within CFN’s strategic priorities (i.e., Matching care to values; Empowering, engaging and supporting patients and their families and caregivers; Improving clinical outcomes; Improving care across the continuum)</li>
                        <li>Research projects must fit within CFN’s patient-oriented research themes (i.e., Improving end-of-life care (EOL)/advance care planning (ACP); Improving acute care/critical care; Optimizing community care/residential care; Optimizing transitions of care)</li>
                        <li>Proposals must demonstrate significant partnerships which will increase translation of project results into policy and/or practice.  Potential for commercialization of research results is an asset although not required.  Proposals must have demonstrated committed cash or eligible in-kind contributions from NCE-eligible partners totaling a minimum of 50% of CFN’s funding. To be clear, if $100,000 is requested from CFN the applicants must secure an additional minimum $50,000 in partner contributions.</li>
                        <li>Networking: In general CFN seeks projects that represent the collaborative efforts of investigators in more than one discipline and at more than one institution, from more than one province, and with the involvement of partners and stakeholders from multiple sectors.  Note: For these smaller Catalyst grants investigators were advised that minimally the proposal needed to describe future plans to address these networking requirements.</li>
                        <li>Research teams must include patients and families, knowledge users, and HQP as meaningfully involved and integral team members.</li>
                    </ol>
