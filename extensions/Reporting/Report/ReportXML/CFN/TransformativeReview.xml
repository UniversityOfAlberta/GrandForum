                <ol>
                    <li>Please complete both sections A and B.</li>
                    <li>Observational studies or studies that do not study the impact of interventions will not be funded.</li>
                    <li><b>Goal of the Competition:</b> This program is designed to fund transformative research projects that are exceptionally innovative and thus have the potential to have a major economic and social impact on the current Canadian health care system as it relates to the care for frail elderly Canadians. CFN defines transformative research as projects that aim to significantly change current practice as it pertains to the frail elderly through the application of current or new scientific/medical concepts, methodologies or practices. It is expected that if successful the knowledge generated from these projects would be applied widely across the Canadian health care system.</li>
                    <li><b>When reviewing/scoring grants please consider that the applicant's were informed that proposals will be judged on the following:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Innovation of the research project with the potential that results would be recognized nationally and globally for scientific excellence.</li>
                            <li>Potential to revolutionize the care of frail elderly Canadians.</li>
                            <li>Potential to have a major economic and social impact.</li>
                            <li>Degree to which project is cross-provincial, multi-institutional, and multi- and interdisciplinary.</li>
                            <li>Degree to which projects have high translational capacity towards improving care for frail elderly Canadians.</li>
                            <li>Each proposal must include the evaluation of one or more: i) patient-centred outcomes, ii) patient/family satisfaction or iii) health economic outcomes.</li>
                            <li>Proposals should have clearly defined research question(s) and knowledge or practice gap(s) for the care of frail elderly Canadians.</li>
                            <li>Proposals must have a well described methodology and must demonstrate that key deliverables and measurable outcomes are achievable within the funding period.</li>
                            <li>Where appropriate, proposals must include a health economist and/or ethicist on the project team.</li>
                            <li>Project team members will be adjudicated for their level of experience and expertise.</li>
                            <li>Budgets: maximum $3M over a maximum period of 3 years.  To expedite the start of the project, successful applicants may be provided with early funding of up to $50,000 to undertake preliminary “pilot” or preparatory work.  Submitted projects must justify the need for pilot/preparatory funding.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Please complete both sections A and B.</li>
                    <li>Observational studies or studies that do not study the impact of interventions will not be funded.</li>
                    <li><b>Goal of the Competition:</b> This program is designed to fund transformative research projects that are exceptionally innovative and thus have the potential to have a major economic and social impact on the current Canadian health care system as it relates to the care for frail elderly Canadians. CFN defines transformative research as projects that aim to significantly change current practice as it pertains to the frail elderly through the application of current or new scientific/medical concepts, methodologies or practices. It is expected that if successful the knowledge generated from these projects would be applied widely across the Canadian health care system.</li>
                    <li><b>When reviewing/scoring grants please consider that the applicant's were informed that proposals will be judged on the following:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Innovation of the research project with the potential that results would be recognized nationally and globally for scientific excellence.</li>
                            <li>Potential to revolutionize the care of frail elderly Canadians.</li>
                            <li>Potential to have a major economic and social impact.</li>
                            <li>Degree to which project is cross-provincial, multi-institutional, and multi- and interdisciplinary.</li>
                            <li>Degree to which projects have high translational capacity towards improving care for frail elderly Canadians.</li>
                            <li>Each proposal must include the evaluation of one or more: i) patient-centred outcomes, ii) patient/family satisfaction or iii) health economic outcomes.</li>
                            <li>Proposals should have clearly defined research question(s) and knowledge or practice gap(s) for the care of frail elderly Canadians.</li>
                            <li>Proposals must have a well described methodology and must demonstrate that key deliverables and measurable outcomes are achievable within the funding period.</li>
                            <li>Where appropriate, proposals must include a health economist and/or ethicist on the project team.</li>
                            <li>Project team members will be adjudicated for their level of experience and expertise.</li>
                            <li>Budgets: maximum $3M over a maximum period of 3 years.  To expedite the start of the project, successful applicants may be provided with early funding of up to $50,000 to undertake preliminary “pilot” or preparatory work.  Submitted projects must justify the need for pilot/preparatory funding.</li>

            <![CDATA[
                <ol>
                    <li>Please complete all sections.</li>
                    <li>Goal of the Competition: This program is designed to fund transformative research projects that are exceptionally innovative and thus have the potential to have a major economic and social impact on the current Canadian health care system as it relates to the care for frail elderly Canadians. CFN defines transformative research as projects that aim to significantly change current practice as it pertains to the frail elderly through the application of current or new scientific/medical concepts, methodologies or practices. It is expected that if successful the knowledge generated from these projects would be applied widely across the Canadian health care system.</li>
                    <li>When reviewing/scoring grants please consider that the applicant's were informed that proposals will be judged on the following:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Proposals must demonstrate the potential for a transformative impact on improving care for frail elderly Canadians and their caregivers, and provide a socio-economic benefit to Canada.</li>
                            <li>Small-scale feasibility studies or strictly observational studies are not eligible for funding under this competition. Proposals are expected to be larger and longer grants than traditionally funded by CFN.  Grants can be up to 3 years in length and have a maximum budget of $3M</li>
                            <li>Transformative research that would be eligible for funding are projects that:
                            <ul>
                                <li>are being scaled up from existing successful demonstration projects</li>
                                <li>apply pathways, processes, tools or technology developed from existing knowledge or evidence into the care of the frail elderly</li>
                                <li>apply care pathways currently in practice in other health care systems in the world</li>
                                <li>build on current CFN funded research to apply it to wider health care systems, more regions or provinces</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Within the scope of the present competition, projects which have the following characteristics will be prioritized for funding:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Those that improve the uptake or application of existing evidence to improve care for frail elderly Canadians</li>
                                <li>Those that seek to improve system changes for the benefit of frail elderly Canadians</li>
                                <li>Proposals that building on previous CFN funded work</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Research projects must fit within CFN’s strategic priorities (i.e., Matching care to values; Empowering, engaging and supporting patients and their families and caregivers; Improving clinical outcomes; Improving care across the continuum)</li>
                            <li>Research projects must fit within CFN’s patient-oriented research themes (i.e., Improving end-of-life care/advance care planning; Improving acute care/critical care; Optimizing community care/residential care; Optimizing transitions of care)</li>
                            <li>Proposals must demonstrate significant partnerships which will increase translation of project results into policy and/or practice.  Potential for commercialization of research results is an asset although not required.  Proposals must have demonstrated committed cash or eligible in-kind contributions from NCE-eligible partners totaling a minimum of 50% of CFN’s funding. To be clear, for example if $100,000 is requested from CFN the applicants must secure an additional minimum $50,000 in partner contributions.</li>
                            <li>Networking: In general CFN seeks projects that represent the collaborative efforts of investigators in more than one discipline and at more than one institution, from more than one province, and with the involvement of partners and stakeholders from multiple sectors.  Note: For these smaller Catalyst grants investigators were advised that minimally the proposal needed to describe future plans to address these networking requirements.</li>
                            <li>Research teams must include patients and families, knowledge users, and HQP as meaningfully involved and integral team members.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
