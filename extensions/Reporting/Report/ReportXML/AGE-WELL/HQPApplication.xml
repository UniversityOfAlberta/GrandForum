                <h3>About AGE-WELL</h3>
<p>AGE-WELL Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Awards in Technology and Aging provide partial funding to highly qualified master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral candidates and provide them with access to training and mentorship opportunities through the AGE-WELL Network of Centres of Excellence. AGE-WELL aims to provide a unique training environment that exposes trainees to multi-disciplinary research environments and to its industry and community partners. AGE-WELL is committed to attracting, developing, and retaining outstanding Highly Qualified Personnel (HQP) in Canada.</p>

<p>AGE-WELL is a pan-Canadian network of industry, non-profit organizations, government, care providers, caregivers, end-users, and academic partners working together using high-quality research to drive innovation and create technologies and services that benefit older adults. Our vision is to harness and build upon the potential of emerging and advanced technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), e-health, information communication technologies (ICTs), and mobile technologies to stimulate technological, social, and policy innovation.</p>

<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>In order to be considered for AGE-WELL Awards, funding applicants must:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Receive financial support from additional sources: home department, supervisor research grants, and/or through government and agency scholarships or awards.</li> 
    <li>Participate full‐time in their respective program at a Canadian post-secondary institution.</li>
    <li>Be engaged in academic study/research aligned with the mission and vision of AGE-WELL.</li>
    <li>Applicants for doctoral awards are restricted to those entering the first or second year of their program.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Applicants who will receive AGE-WELL project funds concurrently with this award period are ineligible to apply to this competition.  For example, a trainee who will be funded through AGE-WELL Core Research Projects, Platform Projects, Cross-Cutting themes, or the Strategic Investment, Collaborative Impact or Catalyst programs during 2016-2017 would be ineligible.</b></p>

<h3>The Awards</h3>
<p>Awards are intended to enhance existing funding support awarded to promising new scholars. Trainees <u>must</u> demonstrate that they receive funding from a source other than AGE-WELL.</p>

<p>We expect to offer the following awards in this 2016 call:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>3</b> Master’s level awards at $10,000 (1 year award)</li>
    <li><b>4</b> PhD level awards at $15,000 per year (2 year award)</li>
    <li><b>3</b> Postdoctoral level awards at $20,000 (1 year award)</li>
</ul>
<p>If successful, trainee funding will be held and disbursed by the trainee’s supervisor in a new account that must be established at the supervisor’s home institution.</p>

<h3>Program Requirements</h3>
<i>Training</i>
<p>Funded trainees will be automatically enrolled in our EPIC training program <i>(Early Professionals, Inspired Careers)</i> and are expected to participate actively in AGE-WELL seminar series and professional development activities (e.g. workshops in commercialization or entrepreneurship) to earn the Innovators of Tomorrow certificate.</p>

<i>Reporting</i>
<p>As per NCE rules, funds must flow from AGE-WELL to the trainee’s primary supervisor at their institution.  Academic institutions receiving AGE-WELL funds in trust are expected to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set up a new account for AGE-WELL funds disbursed during the current AGE-WELL funding cycle.</li>
    <li>Report on expenditures of AGE-WELL funds by submitting a Form 300 to the Network Management Office no later than April 30 of each year for the duration of this funding award.</li>
</ul>
<i>Acknowledging AGE-WELL</i>
<p>AGE-WELL funded trainees will acknowledge the AGE-WELL Award program in their presentations, publications, and other knowledge translation activities related to research conducted during their funding period.  Funded trainees are required to use the AGE-WELL logo on their posters and other materials related to research conducted during their funding period.</p>

<h3>Renewal</h3>
<p>Funded doctoral and postdoctoral applicants may submit one-year renewal applications for a third year of doctoral funding and a second year of postdoctoral funding. Ongoing funding is dependent on performance and achieving milestones outlined in the original application. Funded trainees are expected to submit an annual report through the AGE-WELL Forum reporting system each year. This report is required whether or not the trainee is applying for renewal of funding.</p>

<h3>Admission Criteria</h3> 
<p>All applications will be reviewed by a team of field experts using the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Scholarly Merit &amp; Quality of Proposed Research (40%)</li>
    <li>Fit with AGE-WELL Goals and Priorities (40%)</li>

                        <p>AGE-WELL is inviting proposals in the broad area of technology and aging. The research project may be linked to one of AGE-WELL’s eight <a href='http://www.agewell-nce.ca/research' target='_blank'>Research Workpackages</a>, but does not need to limited to these.  Research should address at least one of our key research questions:</p>

                        <p>The AGE-WELL Network unites leading Canadian private and public companies, government bodies, care providers, end-users and academic partners to develop cohesive critical mass in the technology and aging sector. All AGE-WELL researchers and trainees have access to the AGE-WELL partner network. We expect that the majority of AGE-WELL research projects will be carried out in conjunction with a community or industrial partner, for example: a technology company, a service provider, or a government department or agency.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Specify how your project is aligned with partner goals, their role and contribution in the project and how you will work directly with this partner(s).</li>
                            <li>If your research does not currently involve working with a partner organization, identify the type of partner that would be appropriate for your research and how your research might benefit from partner engagement (e.g. Co-.development of technology, knowledge mobilization, experiential learning). Where possible, AGE-WELL will attempt to link trainee projects with appropriate AGE-WELL partners.</li>
