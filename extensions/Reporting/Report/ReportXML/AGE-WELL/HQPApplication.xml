                <h3>About AGE-WELL</h3>
<p>AGE-WELL Graduate Student and Postdoctoral Awards in Technology and Aging provide partial funding to highly qualified master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral candidates and provide them with access to training and mentorship opportunities through the AGE-WELL Network of Centres of Excellence. AGE-WELL aims to provide a unique training environment that exposes trainees to multi-disciplinary research environments and to its industry and community partners. AGE-WELL is committed to attracting, developing, and retaining outstanding Highly Qualified Personnel (HQP) in Canada.</p>

<p>AGE-WELL is a pan-Canadian network of industry, non-profit organizations, government, care providers, caregivers, end-users, and academic partners working together using high-quality research to drive innovation and create technologies and services that benefit older adults. Our vision is to harness and build upon the potential of emerging and advanced technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), e-health, information communication technologies (ICTs), and mobile technologies to stimulate technological, social, and policy innovation.</p>

                        <p>The AGE-WELL Network unites leading Canadian private and public companies, government bodies, care providers, end-users and academic partners to develop cohesive critical mass in the technology and aging sector. All AGE-WELL researchers and trainees have access to the AGE-WELL partner network. We expect that the majority of AGE-WELL research projects will be carried out in conjunction with a community or industrial partner, for example: a technology company, a service provider, or a government department or agency.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Specify how your project is aligned with partner goals, their role and contribution in the project and how you will work directly with this partner(s).</li>
                            <li>If your research does not currently involve working with a partner organization, identify the type of partner that would be appropriate for your research and how your research might benefit from partner engagement (e.g. Co-.development of technology, knowledge mobilization, experiential learning). Where possible, AGE-WELL will attempt to link trainee projects with appropriate AGE-WELL partners.</li>
