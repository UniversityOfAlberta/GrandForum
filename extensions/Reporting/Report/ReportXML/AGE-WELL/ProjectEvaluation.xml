                <p>The objectives of the NCE program are to mobilize multi-disciplinary research capacity from across Canada, engage partners from multiple academic institutions and various public and private-sector organizations, train the next generation of highly qualified people, work with end users to accelerate the creation and application of new knowledge as well as increase collaboration between research in Canada and abroad.</p>
 
                <p>The aim of the form is to allow the RMC to assess the progress, performance against the key impact objectives of AGE-WELL and demonstrate that the network is effectively working to achieve our goals. Reporting is crucial to the ongoing success and future of AGE-WELL.</p>

                <p>AGE-WELL produces products (technologies, services and policy) that MUST have impact. Progress towards achieving these products can be defined and measured across all projects in a consistent fashion. The Product Readiness Levels (PRL) is a method of estimating maturity and progress towards a product across a 9 point scale. It is based on the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), which is a well-established approach in engineering and other fields.  It has been adapted for use in AGE-WELL in order to be inclusive of the different types of products and research that our members conduct.  Part of this adaptation has been adopting a modified scale that maps the original 9 TRL levels into 5 stages.</p>
                
                <p>AGE-WELL has adapted both scales to be inclusive of the types of projects and products that are part of the Network. Please refer to the <a href='{$wgServer}{$wgScriptPath}/data/AGE-WELL PRL Guidelines.docx'>Product Readiness Levels Guideline</a> for definitions of the PRL levels, as well as example outputs at each level across product type.  Note that the current outputs in this table are only examples and will be added to as we continue to roll out this process, and we receive feedback from members of AGE-WELL.</p>

                <p>Projects are required to justify the current PRL stage they are at so that we can track progress over time. It should be noted that it is expected that some projects may remain at a specific PRL longer than others. Justification and a demonstration of progress is required.</p>

                <p>Each project is required to complete one table related to each of the 5 NCE objectives (Scientific Excellence, Networking and Partnerships, Knowledge Mobilization, Commercialization, and HQP Training) for the past year.</p>
                
                <p>All projects are asked to complete the tables relevant to their project. These tables were developed based on the Balance Scorecard approach and will be used by the RMC to review projects against what was planned at last year’s report. Projects will only be reviewed against themselves and the progress they make towards the objectives they have set. RMC will also submit an overall summary of Core Research Program performance to AGE-WELL’s Board of directors based on an overview of project achievements. The outcome of the RMC review of each project will be used to make a recommendation to the AGE-WELL Board of Directors with respect to potential future investment, if renewed. Projects will only be reviewed against themselves and the progress they make towards the objectives they have set.</p>

                <p>The report consists of qualitative and quantitative information to appropriately capture the progress your project is making on the key impact area.</p>

                <p>The report requests two types of information:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Narrative: a short written account of what the project has accomplished to achieve impact; and</li>
                        <li>Metrics: quantitative data (most values are auto populated via reporting on Forum), substantiating information must be provided for all entered values;</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>For more information on the development of this evaluation or instructions please watch the <a href='https://youtu.be/xYA7mANKkhM' target='_blank'>Webinar</a> posted on the Intranet. You can also find a Word version of the form <a href='http://members.agewell-nce.ca/login/?redirect_to=/network-management/annual-project-progress-evaluation/' target='_blank'>here</a> if you would like to work offline.</p>
