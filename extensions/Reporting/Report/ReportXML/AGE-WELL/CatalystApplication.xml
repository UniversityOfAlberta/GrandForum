            <![CDATA[
                <p>AGE-WELL’s Catalyst Program supports innovative research projects aimed at generating, promoting or accelerating economic and social benefit in the field of technology and aging. This program is essential to the long term direction and future of AGE-WELL.</p>
                        
                <p>The Catalyst program is the first stage in AGE-WELL’s innovation pipeline and will support early-stage, scalable research projects including pilot studies, feasibility studies and novel approaches that are aligned with AGE-WELL’s mission and vision. This program is for projects with new ideas that are challenging the status quo; projects that can demonstrate strong potential for real-world impact, that are mobilizing a research team and planning, or developing project that will closely address problems/needs.</p>

                <p>It is expected that Catalyst projects will lead to major new research initiatives, either as part of AGE-WELL or through other granting agencies.  Successful projects may be suitable for future AGE-WELL investment as they progress along the innovation pipeline, following the initial one year investment. To be eligible for continued funding through AGE-WELL, project deliverable at the end of the grant term must provide justification for advancing the project through a renewal of Catalyst funding or by funding through other AGE-WELL programs (e.g. post-discovery accelerator program). See Project Deliverables and Potential for Continued Funding.</p>
                
                <h3>Award Value and Term</h3>
                <p>Up to $50,000 over 12 months. Renewable for one year.</p>
                
                <p><b>Deadline:</b> March 8th, 2017, 5:00 pm EST.</p>
                
                <h3>Eligibility</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The competition is open to researchers based at Canadian institutions working in the field of technology and aging. AGE-WELL uses the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) definition of “independent researchers” when defining eligible grant holders (see <a href="http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/34190.html" target="_blank">http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/34190.html</a>).</li>
                    <li>The applicant’s host institution must be eligible to hold Tri-Council funding. Canadian universities and investigators who are not already members of AGE-WELL will be required to sign onto the Network Agreement prior to receiving funds.</li>
                    <li>Investigators may not hold more than one AGE-WELL Catalyst grant in the same fiscal year.</li>
                    <li>Catalyst funds cannot be used for activities funded through other AGE-WELL research competitions (e.g. activities that are part of an AGE-WELL Core Research Project).</li>
                    <li>Investigators will normally be expected to include partner organizations in their projects, including as part of any dissemination or commercialization planning. Such organizations should be described in the application, even where the partnership is at a very early stage of development. For reporting purposes, all partnership activities should be quantified in the application.</li>
                    <li>Proposals will ideally demonstrate some level of additional cash and/or in-kind contributions from industry or community partners or describe a plan to secure such contributions. There is no minimum contribution level required for the Catalyst program.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Application and Review Process:</h3>
                <p>Applications will be accepted through AGE-WELL’s Forum Research Portal.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Access the Catalyst Program section of the Forum Research Portal.
                        <ul>
                            <li>All current AGE-WELL Network Investigators have Forum accounts and can access the Catalyst Program application materials through the 'My Applications' tab visible when the log into Forum.</li>
                            <li>Applicants who are not already AGE-WELL Network Investigators must first request access to Forum by emailing <a href="mailto:info@agewell-nce.ca">info@agewell-nce.ca</a> to request an account.  Accounts will be set up within 24 hours (maximum) of receiving the request. Once an account is set up, access application materials through the 'My Applications' tab visible upon login.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Complete the information in each section, uploading attachments as requested. The narrative sections of the application should not exceed 5 pages.</li>
                    <li>It is critical that AGE-WELL research investments support the potential for “real world impact”. A Relevancy Review will be carried out by network stakeholders (older adults and caregivers) to determine the potential for uptake and impact if funded by AGE-WELL. Results of the relevancy review will be taken into consideration by the Research Management Committee during the Scientific Review of the proposal.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Potential for Continued Funding and Project Deliverables</h3>
                <p>The Catalyst program is about demonstrating long-term viability and preparing for the next steps in the innovation pipeline. All teams who anticipate making applications for further AGE-WELL funding will be expected to produce specific and measurable deliverables at the conclusion of their project:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Problem/solution statement providing evidence of co-creation with key stakeholders over the term of the project. This should emphasize the need/problem/aspiration of stakeholder(s).  "Solutions" should be high level and noncommittal as to technology platform at this stage.</li>
                    <li>Environmental scan and/or literature review to provide an overview of the state of the art with respect to the problem/solution statement and will provide the justification for advancing the project.</li>
                    <li>Research project outline for next steps that would map out approach and likely methods for how a follow-up R&D project would be carried out.</li>
                    <li>Preliminary business case addressing either knowledge mobilization and/or commercialization plans; business canvas and basic market analysis.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Key Contact:</h3>
                <p>Questions about the Catalyst Program should be directed to Jeanie Zabukovec, AGE-WELL Research and Partnerships Administrator (<a href="mailto:Jeanie@agewell-nce.ca">Jeanie@agewell-nce.ca</a>).</p>
