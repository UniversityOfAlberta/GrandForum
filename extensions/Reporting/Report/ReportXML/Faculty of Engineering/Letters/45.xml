                <p>This is to inform you that your application for a {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, SABB_DURATION, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} month sabbatical from {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, SABB_START, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} to {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, SABB_END, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} was not recommended for approval by the FEC. The FEC had the following concerns:</p>
                <p>{getText({$report_type}, TABLE, COMMENTS, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}</p>
            
                <p>Your application has been denied as it was found not to be meritorious and of mutual advantage to you and the University. Should you choose to apply for a sabbatical again, I encourage you to address the concerns identified by the FEC. Sabbatical applications are to be submitted by {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, FOLLOWUP_DATE, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}.</p>
