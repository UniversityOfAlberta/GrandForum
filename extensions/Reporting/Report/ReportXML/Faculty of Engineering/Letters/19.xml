                <p>This is to inform you that I will be recommending to the Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) that at the end of your second probationary period, no further appointment be offered to you. My recommendation is based on the following rationale:</p>
                <p>{getText({$report_type}, TABLE, COMMENT, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}</p>
                
                <p>Under Article A6.17.1 of Schedule A, you have a right to appear before FEC and contest the recommendation. It is advisable that you consult the Association of Academic Staff University of Alberta (AASUA) for advice.</p>
                
                Should you decide to contest the recommendation, the following information is to be included in your written submission to the FEC Chair, Simaan Abourizk by {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, FOLLOWUP_DATE, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}, with a copy to me, as Department Chair:
