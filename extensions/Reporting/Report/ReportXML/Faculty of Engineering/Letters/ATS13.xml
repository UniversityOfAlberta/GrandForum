                <p>Each year, the Academic Teaching Staff Evaluation Committee (ATSEC) is charged with the responsibility of awarding merit increments to its Academic Teaching Staff, from an increment pool that is currently equal to 1.2 times the number of eligible staff within the Faculty of Engineering.</p>
                <p>This is to inform you that the ATSEC has approved the award of a {getText(RP_FEC_TABLE, TABLE, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} merit increment rather than the {getText(RP_CHAIR, FEC_REVIEW, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 0, 0)} merit increment recommended by your Department Chair. The ATSEC was impressed by your contributions to the Faculty in relation to your colleagues in the past year, and wishes you well in the coming year. This increment takes effect July 1, {$next_year}.</p>

                <p>I wish to thank you for your dedication and outstanding contributions to the Faculty of Engineering.</p>

                <p>Should you have any procedural questions, please contact Catherine Pretzlaw, at enggdeanea@ualberta.ca.</p>
