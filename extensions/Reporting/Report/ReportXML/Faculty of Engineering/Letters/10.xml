                <p>This is to inform you that as Dean, I have received your Department Chair’s recommendation that no further appointment be offered to you. As such, the decision regarding the granting of a second probation period has been referred to FEC.</p>
                
                <p>Under Article A6.17.1 of Schedule A, you have a right to appear before FEC and contest the recommendation. It is advisable that you consult the Association of Academic Staff University of Alberta (AASUA) for advice.</p>
                
                <p>Please be advised that the date for your case has been scheduled for November 12 - 15 in {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, LOCATION, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}.</p>
                
                Should you decide to contest the recommendation, the following information is to be included in your written submission to the FEC Chair, Simaan Abourizk by {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, FOLLOWUP_DATE, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}, with a copy to me, as Dean:

                </ul>
                
                <p>Materials submitted to the FEC Chair and Department Chair should be submitted electronically, if feasible.</p>
                
                <p>If you choose not to appear before FEC to present your case or submit documentation in support of your position, the FEC decision will be final and binding. Under Article A8.03.1 of Schedule A, you may not appeal this decision to the General Appeals Committee (GAC).</p>
