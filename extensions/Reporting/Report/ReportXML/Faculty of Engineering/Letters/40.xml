                <p>Pursuant to Article A6.21.5(h) of Schedule A, I wish to advise that at its reconsideration meeting of November 12 - 15, FEC did not accept your minimal acceptable position of {getText(RP_CHAIR, FEC_REVIEW, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 0, 0)} incrementation which {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, CHAIR_POSITION, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} supported by your Department Chair. Instead FEC decided to award incrementation of {getText(RP_FEC_TABLE, TABLE, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} for the following reasons:</p>
                <p>{getText({$report_type}, TABLE, COMMENT, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}</p>
