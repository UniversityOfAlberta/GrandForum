                <p>This is to inform you that your application for a {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, SABB_DURATION, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} month sabbatical from {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, SABB_START, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} to {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, SABB_END, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} was recommended for approval by the FEC; however, higher-ranked applications received first approval which has resulted in the Faculty reaching maximum quota and your application not being approved.</p>
            
                <p>You are encouraged to apply for sabbatical again. Should you choose to do so, please ensure your application is submitted by {getText({$report_type}, TABLE, FOLLOWUP_DATE, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}.</p>
