                <h3>Background and Description of Opportunity</h3>
                <p>The Canadian Glycomics Network (GlycoNet) is a Network of Centres of Excellence (NCE) that focuses on the role of glycans (carbohydrates) in health. Areas of focus are therapeutic proteins & vaccines, antimicrobials and chronic disease, in particular diabetes & obesity, genetic diseases involving errors in glycan metabolism, and cancer. Additional information about Network research can be found at www.glyconet.ca.</p>
                <p>In this Request for Proposals we are seeking to fund exploratory projects the successful completion of which would provide preliminary data to support other funding applications either to GlycoNet, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research or a private disease-specific foundation.</p>
                
                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>Projects should:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be aligned with one of the GlycoNet research themes (see glyconet.ca) and be targeted to a specific disease.</li>
                    <li>Be of an applied nature so that after additional funding through other means, the outcomes could lead to novel treatments for disease.</li>
                    <li>Involve the training of Highly Qualified Personnel.</li>
                    <li>Multidisciplinary projects involving two or more research groups will be given preference.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Projects should not:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Concern development or performance of a high-throughput screen for ligands/inhibitors.</li>
                    <li>Concern development of synthetic methodology.</li>
                    <li>Concern basic biochemistry or biology with no tangible translational outcome.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although not required, partner funding would be an asset.</p>
                
                <h3>Funding Available</h3>
                <p>GlycoNet has set aside up to $500,000 for this competition. Proposals may request up to $75,000 in funding. All projects should be completed within 12 months.</p>
                
                <h3>Eligibility</h3>
                <p>Based on NCE requirements, this opportunity is open only to individuals who are eligible to hold Tri-Council funds; i.e., the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) or the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). Furthermore, GlycoNet requires that all investigators receiving Network funding must have other peer-reviewed support. Such support need not be from the Tri-Council.</p>
                <p>Individuals serving as a Project Leader on another GlycoNet-funded project, including the Catalyst grants awarded in 2015, or receiving more than $75,000 a year from GlycoNet are not eligible.</p>
                <p>An individual may serve as the Project Leader on only one Catalyst Grant application and may not be involved in more than two Catalyst Grant applications.</p>
                <p>Questions about project suitability can be directed to the GlycoNet Administrative Centre (glyconet@ualberta.ca).</p>
                
                <h3>Application Form and Submission</h3>
                <p>Potential applicants must register by email to Karli Buckle (kbuckle@ualberta.ca) by Friday, July 15, 2016. Please provide the project title, anticipated budget request and list of investigators involved in the project. This information is not binding and can change when the application is submitted. Upon registration, applicants will receive instructions for completing the application. Funding is anticipated to begin on January 1, 2017.</p>
                
                <h3>Deadline</h3>
                <p>Applications must be submitted by 11:59 pm PST Monday, August 15, 2016. Proposals received after this deadline will not be considered.</p>
                
                <h3>Additional Information</h3>
                <p>Questions about this opportunity can be sent to glyconet@ualberta.ca.</p>

                <h3>Budget (provide as a single Excel file)</h3>
                <p>The front page in the excel file is the total project budget. The other pages (labeled NPI-1, NPI-2 etc; NPI = Network Principal Investigator) are for each involved PI. The budget requested by each PI should be filled in on their respective pages, including the partner contributions that are to be directed to their laboratories. The totals will populate automatically on the first page. The project leader is responsible for combining all of the PI budgets into a single excel file. The first page also contains the budget for the use of the core services in the project.</p>

                <p>Budget Guidelines:<p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Projects can request up to $75,000 for 12 months; longer time periods will be considered on a case-by-case basis and only with sufficient justification.</li>
                    <li>The maximum salary for Graduate Students is $25,000/year and for Postdoctoral Fellows is $42,000/year.</li>
                    <li>Undergraduate student support should be limited to co-op students and should be listed in the technician line item.</li>
                    <li>Equipment is capped at $2,000/year/project.</li>

                            <li>Travel and accommodation for trainees to visit collaborating labs should be included in project budgets.</li>
                            <li>Travel to the annual general meeting will be funded centrally through the Network. It should not be incorporated into project budgets.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>You should work with one of the Network screening partners (CDRD, McMaster HTS lab, SPARC) to develop a budget and a plan of action (i.e., milestones). These costs should be incorporated into the project budget.</li>
                            <li>Funding for the screen itself will go to the screening partner. The development of the assay can be done either at the screening partner, or in the lab of a PI (to be determined in your discussions with the screening partner), with the funding going to the location where the work will be carried out. Please note that all projects will need to develop not only a primary screening method but also a secondary screening method for hit validation.</li>

                            <li>Those of you who have an anticipated need for these core services should contact Todd Lowary(<a href='mailto:tlowary@ualberta.ca'>tlowary@ualberta.ca</a>) by August 15, 2015. We will generate an estimate that can be incorporated into the budget.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>All partner contributions need to be supported by a letter from the partner institution (see below).
                        <ul>
                            <li>Based on NCE guidelines, teaching assistantship support cannot be counted as matching. Similarly, student and PDF fellowships from CIHR, NSERC or SSHRC cannot be counted as matching. Therefore, please do not include these as a partner contribution in your budget. Research fellowships provided by universities or non-federal agencies should be listed as matching and a supporting letter documenting support is needed.</li>
