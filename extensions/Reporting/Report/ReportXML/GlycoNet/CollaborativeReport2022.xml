                <h3>Background and Description of Opportunity</h3>
                <p>The Canadian Glycomics Network (GlycoNet) is a Network of Centres of Excellence that focuses on the role of glycans (carbohydrates) in health. Areas of focus for GlycoNet in Cycle II (2020–2024) are infectious diseases, chronic diseases (including diabetes & obesity), neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Additional information about Network research can be found at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.glyconet.ca'>www.glyconet.ca</a>.</p>
                
                <p>A key goal of GlycoNet is to support research projects that are multi-disciplinary, as defined by the NCE program.  Accordingly, this Request for Proposals seeks to fund projects that involve two or more research groups in different disciplines.</p>
                
                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>Project applications must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Primarily address the GlycoNet research themes and be targeted to the role/use of glycans in reducing the economic burden and/or treatment of infectious diseases, chronic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and/or cancer. Research in other areas of glycomics will be considered, especially those in One Health.</li>
                    <li>Must have multi-disciplinary teams involving researchers as described above.</li>
                    <li>Provide a plan of how equity, diversity and inclusion will be implemented within the project team and its activities.</li>
                    <li>Lead to tangible deliverables by the end of the project, leading to translational research as the next step.</li>
                    <li>Present a knowledge mobilization plan to communicate results to partners and stakeholders.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate a 1:1 financial match with partner funding; at least 50% of the matching funds should be cash.</li>
                    <li>Partner funding must be NCE eligible; in particular, other Canadian Federal funding (e.g., CIHR, NSERC, SSHRC, CFI) is ineligible for matching.</li>
                    <li>Projects with a higher level of matching funds (e.g. 2:1, Partners:GlycoNet) will be viewed more favorably.</li>
                    <li>Provide information on the number and type (i.e. undergraduate, graduate student, PDF, etc.) of expected Highly Qualified Personnel trained each year of the project.</li>
                    <li>List the desired type of professional development training that GlycoNet could provide to HQP, for example, lab rotations, communication and writing skills improvement, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Funding Available</h3>
                <p>GlycoNet has set aside up to $1,300,000 for this competition for both new research and extensions of current projects. At least 50% of the allocated budget will be reserved for new projects, with priority given to researchers who have not received GlycoNet funding in Cycle II (April 1, 2020 to current). Proposals may request up to $150,000 in funding and require 1:1 matching as outlined above. Projects requesting less than the maximum amount will be considered. Projects must be completed within 12-18 months and no later than March 31, 2024.</p>
                
                <h3>Eligibility</h3>
                <p>Based on NCE requirements, this opportunity is open only to individuals who are eligible to hold Tri-Council funds; CIHR, NSERC or SSHRC. Furthermore, GlycoNet requires that investigators, other than Early Career Researchers, receiving Network funding must have other peer-reviewed support. Such support need not be from the Tri-Council. Questions about project suitability can be directed to the GlycoNet Administrative Office (<a href='mailto:info@glyconet.ca'>info@glyconet.ca</a>).</p>
                
                <h3>Proposal and Submission</h3>
                <p>Full Applications must be submitted through the GlycoNet Forum by 23:59 (PT) on Wednesday, May 18, 2022. Applications received after this deadline will not be considered. Notice of award is expected by August 2022. Questions about this opportunity can be sent to <a href='mailto:info@glyconet.ca'>info@glyconet.ca</a>.</p>

                Budget Guidelines:
                <ul>
                    <li>Projects can request up to $150,000 for 12-18 months but must be completed by March 31, 2024.</li>
                    <li>Projects require a 1:1 match with Partner funding; at least 50% of the matching funds should be cash. Partner funding must be NCE eligible; other Canadian Federal funding is ineligible for matching. Projects with a higher level of matching funds (e.g. 2:1, Partners:GlycoNet) will be viewed more favorably.</li>
                    <li>The maximum salary for Graduate Students is $25,000/year and for Postdoctoral Fellows is $45,000/year.</li>
                    <li>Undergraduate student support should be limited to co-op students and should be listed in the technician line item.</li>
                    <li>Equipment is capped at $2,000/year/project.</li>
                    <li>Travel
                        <ul>
                            <li>Conference travel is capped at $1,500/year/NI/project. This fund can be used for the annual Canadian Glycomics Symposium.</li>
                            <li>Travel and accommodation for trainees to visit collaborating labs should be included in project budgets.</li>
                            <li>Travel to the Annual General Meeting will be funded centrally through the Network. It should not be incorporated into project budgets.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Chemical Synthesis and Glycan Structure Analysis Cores
                        <ul>
                            <li>Those of you who have an anticipated need for these core services should contact Warren Wakarchuk (<a href='mailto:warren.wakarchuk@ualberta.ca'>warren.wakarchuk@ualberta.ca</a>).  We will generate an estimate that can be incorporated into the budget.</li>

                    </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Based on NCE guidelines, teaching assistantship support cannot be counted as matching. Similarly, student and PDF fellowships from CIHR, NSERC or SSHRC cannot be counted as matching. Therefore, please do not include these as a partner contribution in your budget. Research fellowships provided by universities or non-federal agencies should be listed as matching and a supporting letter documenting support is needed.</li>
