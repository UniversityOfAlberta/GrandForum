                <p>This is to inform you that the Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) has approved the award of a {getText(RP_FEC_TABLE, TABLE, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 1, 0)} incrementation rather than the {getText(RP_CHAIR, FEC_REVIEW, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 0, 0)} incrementation recommended by your Department Chair. FEC was impressed by your contributions to the Faculty and wishes you continued success in the coming year.</p>
                
                <p>Each year, the FEC is charged with the responsibility of awarding incrementation to its faculty from an increment pool that is currently equal to 1.2 x the number of eligible staff within the Faculty.</p>
                
                <p>I wish to thank you for your dedication and outstanding contribution to the Faculty.</p>
