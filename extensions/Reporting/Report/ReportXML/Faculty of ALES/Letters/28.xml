                <p>Each year, the Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) is charged with the responsibility of awarding incrementation to its faculty, from an increment pool that is currently equal to 1.2 x the number of eligible staff within the Faculty.</p>
                
                <p>As per Article A6.21.5(h) of Schedule A, I am informing you that at its reconsideration meeting on December 7, 2023, FEC did not support your minimal acceptable position and the recommendation of a {getText(RP_CHAIR, FEC_REVIEW, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 0, 0)} increment made by your Department Chair and instead awarded an increment of {getText(RP_FEC_TABLE, TABLE, INCREMENT, {$user_id}, 1, 0)}.</p>
                
                <p>Since you chose to appear before the FEC seeking reconsideration of its preliminary position, you have the right to appeal this decision to the General Appeals Committee (GAC) under Article A8.03.1 of Schedule A. A request must be made to the Chair of the GAC (Provost, cc’d to Faculty Relations), in writing, within 10 working days from the receipt of the letter confirming FEC’s reconsideration decision.</p>
                
                <p>It is advisable that you consult the Associate of Academic Staff University of Alberta (AASUA).</p>
                
                <p>Should you have any procedural questions, please contact the Secretary to FEC, Lori Dammann-Thomson, at 780-492-6232 or sciea@ualberta.ca.</p>
