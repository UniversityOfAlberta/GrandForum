Description
-----------
The PDF class is used to access data from the ``grand_pdf_index`` and ``grand_pdf_report`` tables.  A PDF will contain metadata about the PDF like the reporting year, generation date, submission date and report type.  When a PDF is instantiated, the download url can be accessed by calling the ``getUrl()`` method.  There are also some permissions to help prevent people who should not be seeing a PDF document by callin the ``canUserRead()`` method.

Static Factory Methods

- ``newFromId($id)``
- ``newFromToken($tok)``
